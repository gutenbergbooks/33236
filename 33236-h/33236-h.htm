<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Our knowledge of the present and past fauna of
Europe is as yet insufficient to indicate with precision
the original homes of its component elements, but I
hope that the lines of research laid down here, and
the method of treatment adopted, will aid zoologists
and geologists in collecting materials for a more comprehensive
study of the history of our animals. I
trust also that a fresh impulse will be given by the
publication of this book to the study of the Geographical
Distribution of Species. Collectors of
Beetles, Butterflies, Shells, and Fossils may derive
some useful hints by its perusal and thus direct their
studies, so as to add, by accuracy in observation,
to our knowledge of the former geographical revolutions
which have moulded our islands and continents.
To geographers, a survey of some of the
more important changes in the distribution of land
and water in past times&mdash;based upon the composition
of our fauna&mdash;will be interesting. The subject,
however, is a complex one. I have ventured to
indicate a suitable method of treatment, and as such
this attempt to elucidate the history of the European
fauna should be received.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p><p>This work was written as the outcome of a paper
published in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Irish
Academy</i> (3rd series, vol. iv., 1897), "On the Origin
of the European Fauna." A summary of that paper
appeared in <i>Nature</i> (vol. lvi., 1897), and fuller extracts
of more important parts, with some criticisms, in the
<i>Geological Magazine</i> (N.S., sec. iv., vol. iv., 1897). I
freely acknowledge the value of these criticisms,
which have largely assisted me to amplify and to
improve upon the ideas laid down in the paper.</p>

<p>I have found that it greatly facilitates comprehension
of the arguments used, to give a few maps indicating
in a general way the extent of former seas and
continents. I may in this way, as Mr. Kendall
has pointed out, have submerged many square
miles of land which had never been covered by the
sea,&mdash;at least not within recent geological times,&mdash;but
the maps were intended as illustrations of my
views in a broad spirit only.</p>

<p>Some zoologists may be surprised that, in some
cases, I have not followed the latest views in revised
nomenclature. I felt that in a work of this kind
it was of supreme importance to employ names still
current in our leading text-books, such as <i>Lepus
variabilis</i> for the Mountain Hare, instead of <i>Lepus
timidus</i>. After each chapter I have endeavoured to
give a short summary of contents, while a bibliography
of the principal works and papers consulted
will be found at the end. I should also acknowledge
the aid which I have received from such excellent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
works of reference as the British Museum Catalogues
of Birds, by Dr. Bowdler Sharpe, and those of Reptiles,
Amphibia, and Fishes, by Dr. Günther and Dr.
Boulenger. The valuable works on Mammalia by
Sir W. Flower, Mr. Lydekker, Mr. Grevé, and Dr.
Trouessart, were indispensable to me.</p>

<p>To Sir William Flower, Mr. Lydekker, Professor
Sars, and Professor Smitt, I am especially indebted
for allowing me to reproduce drawings from their
works, and to my friend Mr. Welch for some beautiful
photographs. The Council of the Royal Irish
Academy also kindly gave me permission to reprint
the maps used in illustration of my paper. Professor
Haddon first suggested my writing this book, and
gave me many useful hints; and great assistance was
rendered me by my colleague, Mr. G. H. Carpenter,
in revising the proofs. To both of these kind friends
I desire to acknowledge my deep sense of gratitude.</p>

<h1>THE HISTORY OF THE<br />
EUROPEAN FAUNA.</h1>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.<br />

INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Every student of natural history, whether he be
interested in birds, butterflies, or shells, contributes
his share of facts which help to show how the fauna
of his country has originated. The capture of a
Swallow-tail or of a Marbled White Butterfly in England
at once furnishes material for reflection as to the
reason of its absence from Scotland and Ireland.
Why should the Nightingale allow its beautiful song
to be heard in England, and never stray across
the Channel to the sister isle or cross the borders of
North Britain? Lovers of bird-life and sportsmen,
who have observed the habits of the Ptarmigan in the
wild mountain recesses of Scotland, are aware that
nowhere else in the British Islands do we meet with
this interesting member of the grouse family, and
many no doubt have allowed their minds to dwell
upon the causes of its singularly local distribution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span></p><p>All these animals have a wide range in other parts
of the world. In past times, before man began to
make observations on the geographical distribution of
birds and butterflies, or even before the appearance of
man in Northern Europe, they may have lived all
over the British Islands. For some reason or other
they are perhaps dying out or withdrawing towards
their original home, which may either be northward,
or to the east or south. If we had some clue as to
their former history from fossil evidence&mdash;or, in other
words, if their remains had been preserved to us in
geological deposits,&mdash;we should have less difficulty in
deciding this problem. But butterflies are scarcely
ever preserved in a fossil state, and birds very rarely.
We know little or nothing, therefore, of their past
history from direct evidence, and are obliged to trust
to indirect methods of research which will be indicated
later on.</p>

<p>Mammals and Snails tell us their story more plainly.
The bones of the former and the shells of snails are
easily preserved, and thus furnish us with the necessary
data as to their past history, for we find them
abundantly in most of the recent geological deposits.
Among the mammals of the British Islands there
are some instances of distribution which much
resemble those I have quoted. Thus the Arctic Hare
(<i>Lepus variabilis</i>) is in the British Islands confined to
Ireland and to the mountains of Scotland; and if it
were not for the fact that its bones have been discovered
in a cave in the south-west of England, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
should perhaps never have known that, formerly, it
must have inhabited that country as well. Of other
mammals we possess fossil and also historical evidence
of their having once lived in these islands.
Such are the Wolf and the Wild Boar, both of which
were abundant in Great Britain and Ireland. The
latter is a distinctly southern species. We assume
this, because its remains have never been found in
high northern latitudes; nor does it now occur in
Northern Europe or Northern Asia, whilst all its
nearest relatives live in sub-tropical or tropical
climates. The Arctic Hare, on the contrary, has
probably come to us from the north. Its remains
are unknown even in Southern Europe, and the
more we approach the Arctic Regions, the more
abundant it becomes. Thus we have here two
instances of British mammals, one of which, the
Wild Boar, has died out&mdash;as it were in a southerly
direction; whilst the other, the Arctic Hare, is apparently
retreating towards the north.</p>

<p>There are also some British mammals of which we
have no fossil history, at least of which no remains
have as yet been found in these islands. Such a
one is the Harvest Mouse (<i>Mus minutus</i>). It has
a somewhat restricted range in England, and only
just crosses the Scottish border in the east. From
the rest of Scotland and from the whole of Ireland
it is absent. To judge from this distribution, in
connection with the fact of its being unknown as a
British fossil species, it is probably a late immigrant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
to England, and has not had time to spread, throughout
Scotland at any rate. But it is also absent
from Scandinavia, from the Spanish peninsula, from
almost the whole of Italy and the Alps, as also from
the Mediterranean Islands, whilst the little mouse
occurs abundantly right across Siberia. We shall
learn more about centres of dispersion later on;
meanwhile I should mention that such a distribution
indicates that the Harvest Mouse has most likely
originated in the east, and has spread from there
westward in recent geological times.</p>

<p>Conchologists have long ago been acquainted with
the fact that many molluscs, for example the so-called
"Stone-cutter" Snail (<i>Helix lapicida</i>) and the "Cheese
Snail" (<i>Helix obvoluta</i>), have a very restricted range
in the British Islands. Both are entirely absent
from Scotland and Ireland, the Cheese Snail being
confined to South-eastern England. The Stone-cutter
has rather a wider range, is even known from
a Welsh locality, and is met with as far north as
Yorkshire. Their distribution would indicate, therefore,
that while both are recent immigrants, the
Cheese Snail is probably the last comer. This
supposition is in so far supported by fossil evidence,
as the latter is unknown in the fossil state, whilst the
Stone-cutter has been described by Messrs. Kennard
and Woodward (p. 243)<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> as occurring in the cave
deposit known as the Ichtham fissure, and also from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
several English pleistocene and holocene deposits.
The Stone-cutter can scarcely be looked upon as a very
recent immigrant in the light of this evidence, though
we have no proof of its having ever had a much
wider range in the British Islands than it has to-day.</p>

<p>Among the lichens, which so abundantly cover the
rocks and trees in South-western Ireland, and which
impart such a characteristic feature to the scenery,
we find a beautifully spotted slug (<i>Geomalacus maculosus</i>).<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
It is a stranger to the rest of the British
Islands, and indeed occurs nowhere else in Northern
Europe. We have to travel as far as Northern
Portugal before we again meet with it, and it is
there also that its nearest relations live.</p>

<p>Many more similar examples might be quoted, but
enough, I think, has been said to show that the
British fauna is made up of several elements whose
original homes may lie widely apart and in different
directions. We have fossil evidence that some of
the northern species, and also a few of the southern
ones, have become extinct within comparatively
recent times; others are apparently on the verge of
extinction, whilst many not only maintain their
position in the constant struggle for existence, but
are even extending their range.</p>

<p>The problem of tracing the origin of the British
fauna, or at least that of some of the more
characteristic members of every section or element,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
appears at first a somewhat difficult task. Indeed,
the means of dispersal of the various groups of
animals are so different that it occurred to me it
might be better to deal with the mammals, the
birds, the reptiles, and so forth, all separately. This
idea I have attempted to follow to some extent, with
most satisfactory results. The British fauna of the
present day is no doubt complex, but no more so
than the fauna of the most recent of our geological
deposits&mdash;the Pleistocene. However, when we go
back still further and look at the earlier Tertiary
remains, we find the fauna becoming less complex.
Northern species disappear, and the strata are
entirely filled with the remains of southern animals
and plants. Geologists indeed are quite unanimous
in their belief, that the fauna of the British Islands
during the earlier epochs of the Tertiary Era was a
southern one; that it then gradually became more
temperate, until at last, in more recent times, decidedly
northern forms invaded the country. These seem
to have driven out&mdash;to some extent at least&mdash;the
southern species; but more recently again, the
southerners, reinforced by an eastern contingent,
appear to have gained territory and are advancing
into the area held by the northerners. The eastern
invasion does not seem to have affected Ireland at
all, and we find the country there divided between the
southern and northern animals. We can thus roughly
construct a map as I have done here, showing, by
means of horizontal and sloping lines, the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
areas inhabited at the present time by the species of
northern, southern, and eastern origin (<a href="#Figure01">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span>&mdash;Map of the British Islands, indicating approximately the
areas inhabited by the northern, southern, and eastern animals.
The horizontal lines represent the areas of northern species, the
sloping lines those of southern and eastern ones.</p>

<p>In the problems which are being discussed in this
work I have often found it of advantage, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
facilitate the comprehension of the arguments used, to
give maps. Some of these represent the geographical
conditions at the particular epoch referred to in the
text, but they merely claim to give a general idea.
There was never any intention to make them correspond
with all the data of which we have geological
evidence. They are what I might call "diagrammatic."
In comparing them with reconstructions of former
physical geography such as have been attempted from
time to time, I hope geologists will therefore deal
leniently with the faults I may have committed, and
remember that the maps are "impressions," or "diagrams,"
and not faithful representations of all the
geographical revolutions witnessed by some of our
remote forefathers at any particular period.</p>

<p>The knowledge we gain from a study of the British
Tertiary deposits enables us to affirm positively that
both the eastern and the northern species arrived in
these islands comparatively recently, but that the
southern forms must have migrated northward from
the Continent long ages ago. Since the northern
and the eastern migrations&mdash;that is to say, those
coming from the north and east&mdash;were the last to
arrive in Northern Europe, the remains of the animals
contained in the most recent deposits of that portion
of our continent will furnish us with a clue as to the
extent of the area inhabited by them. This is not
all, however. It is also possible to discover from these
remains the direction which the animals that they
belonged to came from. As we shall learn later on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
a migration on a vast scale entered Europe during
the Pleistocene epoch&mdash;the most recent of the geological
epochs, during which great extensions of
glaciers occurred in the mountainous regions of
Europe. The latter period is known to us as the Ice
Age or Glacial period. This will be described more
fully in Chapter II., meanwhile I may mention that
we presume that this migration came from the east,
because no remains of the members of that particular
fauna are known from Spain, Southern Italy, Scandinavia,
Ireland, or from the Balkan peninsula. The
number of species evidently belonging to this same
migration, moreover, become fewer as we proceed
westward, and a large proportion of them still inhabit
Northern Asia, though most of them are now extinct
in Europe. After having thoroughly studied such a
recent geological migration, we learn to understand
others better, though the more ancient they are, the
fewer are the traces and the more difficult are they to
follow.</p>

<p>Then again we have to take into consideration the
fact, that whilst mammals, particularly the larger
herbivores, are forced to migrate frequently owing
to scarcity of food or temporary changes of climate,
many of the invertebrates remain practically unaffected
by either. Most of our land mollusca, for instance,
are satisfied with meagre provender, and stand extremes
of climate well, as long as there is sufficient
moisture. As a result of their peculiar disposition,
many of them, no doubt, have survived through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
several geological epochs, and have witnessed vast
geographical revolutions in their immediate surroundings,
whilst mammals are comparatively short-lived.
Being driven from one country to another, and exposed
to innumerable enemies, new types appear and
old ones rapidly vanish; in fact, there are almost
constant changes in the mammalian fauna as we
pass from one epoch to another.</p>

<p>I have until now referred more particularly to the
British fauna and the North European in general,
because the history of our own animals interests
us all more than those of any other European area.
It is, moreover, preferable to commence our investigations
into the origin of the European fauna
by the study of a small district. This should, if
possible, be an island. If we took a slice of the
continent like France or Germany, we should find
the problem more complex. Instead of choosing
the British Islands, we might, however, take an island
like Corsica or Sardinia. In either of these we should
discover peculiarities in the composition of their fauna
precisely similar to those which I have indicated to
be present in the British fauna. We should find
probably a more striking endemic<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> element, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
with us is so meagre that it can almost be left
unnoticed; the main features, however, remain
nearly the same. The fauna of both of these
islands is composed of a strong southern element,
of an eastern and a northern one, and in addition
we have here species whose ancestors lived in
Western Europe.</p>

<p>Before investigating more minutely the problems
suggested by the composition of the faunas of these
insular and also of some continental areas, it is
necessary that we should thoroughly understand
all about the migrations of animals. One of the
principal objects of this work is to show how the
autochthonous animals of Europe, <i>i.e.</i>, those which
have originated there, may be distinguished from the
immigrants, and to trace the latter to the home
of their ancestors. But in doing so, it is necessary
to refer to the many important geographical changes
which have occurred in Europe during the latest
geological epochs. The study of the geographical
distribution of the European fauna, as expounded in
this work, will in many instances confirm the theories
as to geographical changes based upon geological
foundations. But in every case the views herein
advocated are founded upon the geographical distribution
of living and extinct organisms alone.</p>

<p>A terrestrial mammal like the deer can, under
ordinary circumstances, only reach one part of a
country from another by walking or running to it;
but a beetle, such as the cockchafer, has two different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
modes of progression. It may walk or fly. In both,
however, there is a third mode of transport&mdash;an involuntary
one. The deer may be suddenly seized by
a flood whilst crossing a river, and carried far away
without necessarily coming to grief. The beetle in
a similar manner could be transported to a distant
country, or it might be caught in a whirlwind and
blown hundreds of miles off.</p>

<p>We may thus distinguish between the natural or
active and the accidental or passive means of distribution
of animals. The active mode of dispersal again
may be only migratory, as in most animals, or periodic
and migratory, as in some birds and fishes. It is of
course the tendency of every species to spread in all
directions from its original home, provided it does not
encounter obstacles, such as want of food, unsuitability
of climate or soil, or barriers such as mountains,
rivers, or the sea. Birds might be thought to be little
interfered with by any of these barriers, but, as Dr.
Wallace has shown, they are almost as much affected
by them in their distribution as mammals are.</p>

<p>This then is the ordinary migratory distribution.
Periodic distribution obtains with migratory birds
and fishes. The annual flight of swallows to their
northern summer residence comes under the heading
of periodic migration or distribution, but apart from
this, the swallow must seek to extend its range by
the ordinary method, like every other animal.
Similarly, the herring migrates periodically into
shallow water to spawn, only to return again to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
deeper home, where, as its numbers increase, there
must be a tendency to spread. We have in these
cases, therefore, both a periodic and an ordinary
movement of migration.</p>

<p>Now, in studying the composition of a fauna, and
especially its origin, it is of the utmost importance to
be able to determine approximately the percentage of
accidental arrivals and of the ordinary migrants&mdash;that
is to say, of those which have reached the
country owing to accidental distribution, and of
animals which have adopted the usual course of
migration. It is of all the more import to review
this subject of accidental, or, as Darwin called it, "the
occasional means" of distribution, as both he and
Dr. Wallace have, I venture to think, somewhat over-estimated
its significance. No one doubts that accidental
transportal takes place, but the question is
whether the accidentally transported animals arrive
living and reach a spot where suitable food is procurable,
and whether they are able to propagate their
own species in the new locality. For it must be clear
to anybody that the accidental transportal of a beetle
or of a snail to a new country cannot affect its fauna
or add one permanent member to it unless all these
conditions are fulfilled. As a matter of fact, only
exceedingly few instances are on record of man
having witnessed, for example, the accidental
transportal across the sea to an island of a live
animal.</p>

<p>To mention an example, Colonel Feilden informs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
us (<i>Zoologist</i>, 1888) that, when living on the island
of Barbadoes, an alligator arrived one day on the
shore, and at the same time a tree measuring 40 feet
in length, which was recognised as a Demerara species,
was likewise stranded. He thinks that there can be
no doubt that the alligator, which was alive when it
reached Barbadoes, was transported by the tree, thus
covering a distance of 250 miles from the nearest
land. Numerous observations on the accidental
transportal of seeds and tree-trunks from one island
to another, and from a continent to an island, have
been recorded, and even on our own shores we may
witness the occasional arrival of such vegetable products
from a far distant land. On the west coast of
Ireland it not unfrequently happens that large West
Indian beans are stranded, and in this as well as in
many other similar cases the seeds have often proved
none the worse for their prolonged immersion in sea-water.
That locusts are sometimes blown to great
distances from the land is not so surprising, since
their power of steering through the air is very limited.
Darwin mentions (p. 327) having caught one 370
miles from the coast of Africa, and that swarms of
them sometimes visited Madeira. Sir Charles Lyell
relates that green rafts composed of canes and brush-wood
are occasionally carried down the Parana River
in South America by inundations, bearing on them
the tiger, cayman, squirrels, and other quadrupeds.</p>

<p>But though actual observations of such abnormal
instances of the dispersal of animals are few, many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
experiments have been made to demonstrate the possibility
of a passive transportal of species over wide
distances. It was especially Darwin who gave a great
stimulus by setting the example to those interested
in natural history in the conduct of such researches.
He was struck by the fact that, though land-shells
and their eggs are easily killed by sea-water,
almost all oceanic islands, even the smallest and most
isolated, are inhabited by them, and felt that there
must be some unknown but occasionally efficient
means for their transportal (p. 353). To quote his
words: "It occurred to me that land-shells, when
hibernating and having a membranous diaphragm
over the mouth of the shell, might be floated in chinks
of drifted timber across moderately wide arms of the
sea. And I find that several species in this state
withstand uninjured an immersion in sea-water during
seven days: one shell, the <i>Helix pomatia</i>, after having
been thus treated and again hibernating, was put into
sea-water for twenty days, and perfectly recovered.
During this length of time the shell might have been
carried by a marine current of average swiftness to a
distance of 660 geographical miles. As this <i>Helix</i>
has a thick calcareous operculum, I removed it, and
when it had formed a new membranous one, I again
immersed it for fourteen days in sea-water, and again
it recovered and crawled away. Baron Aucapitaine
has since tried similar experiments: he placed one
hundred land-shells, belonging to ten species, in a
box pierced with holes, and immersed it for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
fortnight in the sea. Out of the hundred shells,
twenty-seven recovered. The presence of an operculum
seems to have been of importance, as out of
twelve specimens of <i>Cyclostoma elegans</i> which it thus
furnished, eleven revived. It is remarkable, seeing
how well the <i>Helix pomatia</i> resisted with me the salt-water,
that not one of fifty-four specimens belonging
to four other species of <i>Helix</i> tried by Aucapitaine,
recovered. It is, however, not at all probable that
land-shells have often been thus transported; the feet
of birds offer a more probable method."</p>

<p>We have here positive evidence that such shells as
<i>Helix pomatia</i> and <i>Cyclostoma elegans</i> might easily be
transported to an island from the mainland. The
former occurs in France, Holland, and England, and
the latter all along western continental Europe and
England. And yet neither of these species inhabits the
Canary Islands, Madeira, or Ireland, none of which are
at too great a distance from Europe to be within easy
reach for a floating object. The fact that <i>Cyclostoma
elegans</i> does not live in Ireland is of particular interest
in connection with the floating-theory just quoted, as
on all sides of Ireland dead specimens have been picked
up on the shore, showing that marine currents carry
specimens and have thus transported them for
countless centuries. Nevertheless the species has not
established itself in Ireland. If such a fate meets a
land-shell of the type of <i>Cyclostoma elegans</i>, it may be
asked, with some justification, what chance slugs or
the smaller non-operculated species would have to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
reach an island like Ireland alive from the mainland,
and to colonise it successfully.</p>

<p>Both slugs and their eggs are killed by a short
immersion in sea-water, as I have proved experimentally.
I have also subjected slugs, in the act of
crawling on twigs, to an artificial spray of sea-water.
This seemed to irritate their tender skins to such an
extent that they curled themselves up, released their
hold on the twig and let themselves drop to the
ground. If we supposed, therefore, that a slug had
successfully reached the sea, transported on a tree-trunk,
the moisture would tend to lure it forth from
its hiding-place under the bark, whilst the mere spray
would prove fatal to its existence. Those species of
snails and slugs which lead an underground existence,
rarely venturing above ground, such as <i>Testacella</i> and
<i>Coecilianella</i>, would have even less chance of being
accidentally carried to some distant island.</p>

<p>The suggestion advanced by Darwin (p. 353), that
young snails just hatched might sometimes adhere to
the feet of birds roosting on the ground and thus be
transported, appears to me so extremely improbable
as to be scarcely worth serious consideration. Indeed,
as Darwin himself acknowledged later on, it does not
help us very much to suggest possible modes of
transport. What we require is direct evidence. How
far we are, however, from obtaining it, may be inferred
from Mr. Kew's remark (p. 119), that "we have
little or no actual evidence of precise modes of
dispersal even for short distances on land."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p><p>A very curious statement was made by a well-known
French conchologist, the late M. Bourguignat,
with regard to introductions of mollusca. Whether
he had any actual facts collected in support of it, I
cannot say, but he maintained that species accidentally
transported, with the exception of those under maritime
influence, can only be acclimatised from north to
south, and not from south to north&mdash;from east to
west, but not from west to east (p. 353).</p>

<p>The whole theory of the accidental or abnormal
dispersal of mollusca appears to have been originated
by Darwin, in order to account for their presence on so-called
<i>Oceanic islands</i>. His views were strongly supported
by Wallace, who defines these islands (p. 243)
as those which are of volcanic or coralline formation
usually far from continents, entirely without indigenous
land mammals or amphibians, but with a fair
number of birds and insects, and usually with some
reptiles.</p>

<p>I do not wish it to be understood that I am in any
way undervaluing the great works of these distinguished
naturalists. Darwin's views have had
more influence in advancing Zoology than those of any
man, and his fame is unassailable. Nevertheless, I
feel that his theories regarding the origin of the faunas
of oceanic islands require revision.</p>

<p>The formerly prevalent belief of the permanence of
ocean basins has been shaken by the utterances of
some of the greatest geologists of our day, whilst
many positively assert that what is now deep sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
of more than 1000 fathoms was dry land within
comparatively recent geological epochs. Thus the
Azores are classed by Darwin and Wallace among
the oceanic islands&mdash;that is to say, among such
as have received their fauna and flora by flotsam
and jetsam. But Professor Neumayr believes, on
geological grounds, that the Old and New Worlds
were connected by a land-bridge during Tertiary
times right across the Atlantic, and that the
Canary Islands, Madeira, and Azores (p. 547)
are the last remnants of this continent. This
meets with the entire approbation of Dr. von
Ihering, who has recently re-investigated the subject
from a faunistic point of view (p. 135). Take
another instance of one of Wallace's most typical
oceanic islands, the Galapagos Group. Their fauna
and flora have recently been most thoroughly
re-explored by an American expedition, the result
of which, according to Dr. Baur, goes to show
that these islands must have formed part of the
mainland of South America at no distant date. The
fauna and flora are therefore to be regarded as having
reached them in the normal mode, viz., by migration
on land. According to Mr. Beddard (p. 138), it is
difficult to see how earthworms could be transported
across the sea. Floating tree-trunks have been observed
far out at sea, but unless the water remained
absolutely calm during the long period necessary for
the drifting by currents so that no splashing occurred,
the worms would probably be killed. Yet earthworms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
do occur on oceanic islands. It is indeed quite
possible that our views with regard to the origin of
the remainder of the Pacific Islands may change very
materially, and once more revert to what Dr. Gould
expressed nearly fifty years ago in the following
words: "From a consideration of the land-shells on
the Pacific Islands, it seems possible to draw some
fair inferences as to the relations of the lands which
once occupied the area of the Pacific Ocean, and
whose mountain peaks evidently now indicate or
constitute the islands with which it is now studded."
Indeed Dr. von Ihering goes so far as to positively
state that in his opinion the Polynesian Islands are
not volcanic eruptions of the sea floor, which being
without life were successively peopled from Australia
and the neighbouring islands, but the remains of
a great Pacific continent, which was in early
mesozoic times connected with other continental land
masses (<i>a</i>, p. 425).</p>

<p>Before coming to a decision on the part played by
flotsam and jetsam in the constitution of an island
fauna, those who have studied the problem on the
spot should, however, have a voice in the matter.
And though, from my experience in northern latitudes,
I feel sure that island faunas there are but slightly
affected by occasional dispersal of species, Mr.
Hedley, who has made the fauna of the Pacific
Islands his special study, assures me that drift
migration plays an important <i>rôle</i> in that region.
I hope we may soon have a more detailed account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of his particular observation bearing on this interesting
subject.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. Simpson, who has gained
considerable experience of oceanic dispersal in the
West Indian region, though he acknowledges having
often noticed bamboo rafts, which would be suitable in
the transportal of invertebrates, nevertheless does not
attach much importance to this means of distribution.
"The fact," he remarks, "that the operculates (operculate
land-shells) form so large a proportion of the
Antillean land-snail fauna, that a majority of the
genera are found on two or more of the islands and
the mainland, while nearly every species is absolutely
restricted to a single island, appears to me to be
very strong testimony in favour of a former general
land connection" (p. 428).</p>

<p>Amphibians are affected in the same manner by
sea-water as slugs are. The accidental transportal of
an amphibian from the mainland to an island is therefore
almost inconceivable. And the presence of frogs,
toads, and newts in the British Islands, in Corsica
and Sardinia, indicates, if nothing else did, that all
these islands were at no distant date united with the
continent of Europe.</p>

<p>As regards the terrestrial reptiles, the case is somewhat
different. Many of them readily take to the
sea, and, as probably all snakes and some lizards are
able to swim, it is possible that sometimes, though
very rarely, they might reach islands if not too far
from a continent. Instances of accidental transportal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
of land-reptiles to islands have actually been observed.
But the fact of the occurrence of such instances by no
means proves that reptiles thus conveyed are able to
establish themselves permanently in their new home.
Sir Charles Lyell records in his <i>Principles of Geology</i>
that a large boa-constrictor was once seen floating to
the island of St. Vincent, twisted round the trunk of
a tree. It appeared so little injured by its long
voyage from South America, that it captured some
sheep before it was killed.</p>

<p>Mammals might be accidentally conveyed to islands
on such rafts as have been described by Sir Charles
Lyell, and there are instances on record of their
having crossed short distances of sea by swimming.
Elephants and also deer and pigs are good swimmers,
the former having been known to swim for six hours
at a stretch. "But," remarks Mr. Lydekker (p. 13),
"it may be assumed that about twenty miles is the
utmost limit which mammals are likely to cross by
swimming, even when favoured by currents. Such
passages as these must, however, be of very rare
occurrence, for a terrestrial mammal is not likely
to take it into its head to swim straight out to sea
in an unknown direction. Moreover, supposing a
mammal, near to a particular island, to have arrived
there by swimming, unless it happen to be a pregnant
female, or unless another individual of the same
species but of the opposite sex should arrive soon
after (a most unlikely event), it would in due course
die without being able to propagate its kind."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p><p>All zoologists, indeed, are quite in accord with Dr.
Wallace's view as expressed in <i>Island Life</i> (p. 74).
"Whenever we find that a considerable number of
the mammals of two countries exhibit distinct marks
of relationship, we may be sure that an actual land-connection,
or at all events an approach to within
a very few miles of each other, has at one time
existed." As all the European islands come under
this category, their mammals exhibiting distinct
relationship with those on the European continent,
they all have been connected with it formerly.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most powerful of all agents in the
transportal of species by accidental means is man.
But his actions may be accidental as well as intentional.
We have therefore to distinguish between
the animals disseminated all over the world by pure
chance, and those which have been introduced into
new countries purposely. Invertebrates, such as
snails, centipedes, woodlice, beetles, and cockroaches,
are constantly being unintentionally carried with
vegetables, fruit, trees, and with timber from one
country to another. Earthworms are sometimes
transported in the balls of earth in which the roots
of trees are enveloped. As regards molluscs, Mr.
Kew believes (p. 178) that during the last three
centuries at least, human agency has influenced
their disposal more than all other causes taken
together. A large number of species of invertebrates
in America are said to owe their existence in that
country to accidental introduction by man. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
most cases, however, no particular reason can be
assigned why they should have been thus introduced,
and as a matter of fact there are always individual
differences of opinion as to the precise number of
such. Certain it is, that though the number of
supposed introductions from Europe to America
is very large, those which have been carried from
America to Europe is exceedingly small. In fact,
I remember only two instances of accidental animal
importations from America which have firmly
established themselves in Europe, viz., a small
fresh-water mollusc, <i>Planorbis dilatatus</i>, and the
much-dreaded vine-pest, <i>Phylloxera vastatrix</i>.</p>

<p>As a rule the animals die out very shortly after
their arrival on foreign soil. Many instances,
nevertheless, are on record, especially in the case
of molluscs, where snails thus transported have not
only survived but are apparently in a flourishing
condition and spreading. <i>Helix aspersa</i>, for example,
our large garden snail, has been naturalised in many
foreign countries by French and Portuguese sailors,
who had taken them on board their ships as food.</p>

<p>It certainly cannot be denied that a number of
species among almost all groups of invertebrates have
been unintentionally conveyed by man from Europe
into foreign countries. It has been proposed by Dr.
von Ihering to apply the term "cenocosmic" to those
species which have become spread all over the world
through artificial means, and thus to distinguish
them from cosmopolitan ones which have attained a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
similar range naturally. The latter he calls "palincosmic"
species (<i>a</i>, p. 422). Many so-called cenocosmic
ants are believed by Dr. von Ihering to be
palincosmic. We are altogether too apt to regard
cosmopolitan as synonymous with introduced, and we
should hesitate before concluding that because one of
our common European species occurs in Australia or
South America, it must have been transported there
recently by human agency. Some of our widely-distributed
forms are probably of very great antiquity,
and may have spread to distant lands in early Tertiary
times, when a different state of the geographical
conditions enabled them to do so.</p>

<p>I cannot quote a more appropriate instance
than the molluscan fauna of Madeira. No less
than thirteen of the Madeiran snails are looked
upon as having been introduced from Europe by
human agency, on the sole evidence that these
happen to be common European species. Yet the
correctness of this supposition must be questioned
in face of the interesting observation made by
Darwin (p. 357), "that Madeira and the adjoining
islet of Porto Santo possess many distinct
but representative species of land-shells, some of
which live in crevices of stone; and although large
quantities of stone are annually transported from
Porto Santo to Madeira, yet this latter island has not
become colonised by the Porto Santo species. Nevertheless,
both islands have been colonised by European
land-shells, which no doubt had some advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
over the indigenous species." Darwin, therefore,
meets the evident anomaly by suggesting that the
European species are supposed to possess some
advantages as colonisers. But the true explanation
appears to me to lie in the supposition that the
European land-shells found in the Madeiran Islands
are all, or for the greater part, ancient forms which
survived both there and on the continent, whilst the
remainder of the forms inhabiting these islands are
either such as are now extinct in Europe, or have
become modified since their arrival there from the
continent at a time when extensive land-connections
allowed a free migration by land.</p>

<p>The theory of accidental introductions is an extremely
popular one. It allows free scope to a host
of speculations, and once the idea has taken firm
root that a certain species is introduced, especially
among the class of naturalists who by way of experiment
are wont to create new centres of dispersion
in their own neighbourhood, evidence to the contrary
must be of the most convincing nature to shake the
popular belief. Thus, it is almost regarded as an
established fact by conchologists and others, that the
fresh-water mussel (<i>Dreyssensia polymorpha</i>) was introduced
into England at the beginning of this century.
Though it has been proved that this species is quite
unable to live in pure sea-water, yet the view that it
has been carried from the Black Sea ports to this
country attached to the bottom of ships is maintained
by many, whilst others incline to the theory that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
shell came with timber. But <i>Dreyssensia polymorpha</i>
was by no means always confined to the Caspian and
Black Sea areas; it occurs abundantly in the lower
continental boulder-clay (see p. <a href="#Page_230">230</a>), and no doubt it
had at one time a much wider geographical distribution.
It appears to me possible, that it was able to maintain
itself in certain fresh-water lakes and slow-flowing
rivers in Northern Europe, from which it might have
spread since the introduction of canals into Europe at
the beginning of the century. As the larva of this
fresh-water mussel is free-swimming, its propagation
is much favoured by canals. Quickly-flowing rivers
are fatal to its existence, since the delicate larvæ are
swept out to sea and perish. Such an hypothesis as
this is strengthened by the fact of its recent discovery
in a sandy layer fifteen feet below the present surface
under the streets of London in a deposit which probably,
as Mr. Woodward remarks (p. 8), was accumulated
in the early days of the city's existence. In
spite of Mr. Woodward's interesting find, and Dr.
Jeffreys' opinion, who always maintained that this
shell was indigenous to England, popular belief still
clings tenaciously to the introduction theory.</p>

<p>Among man's intentional introductions into a new
country, no instance is better known than that of the
rabbit to Australia. Rabbits are entirely confined to
Europe. In their transplantation to Australia they
were carried to a country with a different climate and
among new surroundings. Yet the rabbits flourished,
and within comparatively few years increased to such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
an extent as to become a burden and pest to the
country. It may be remembered though, that, owing
to the complete absence of small carnivores, which
act with us as a check upon the too rapid increase of
this rodent, the speed with which it established itself
in the new surroundings is not so very surprising.</p>

<p>Many of the English settlers in the New World felt
that America lacked the presence of our familiar
birds. The homely sparrow was therefore brought
over, with the result that the Agricultural Department
of the United States is now devising means for its
destruction, so rapid has been its increase.</p>

<p>Similarly, the inhabitants of Jamaica, annoyed by
the great profusion of rats in their island, sent over to
India for a number of mongoose. These have decimated
the rats since their arrival, but they have
multiplied to such an extent as to be a serious
menace to the native fauna.</p>

<p>To give an instance nearer home, the Capercaillie
(<i>Tetrao urogallus</i>) was successfully introduced into
Scotland in 1837. From its different centres of
distribution it is spreading in all directions where
sufficient cover is obtainable. But this case differs
from the others very materially, in so far as this bird
was formerly a native of Scotland, and only became
extinct during the last century.</p>

<p>However, although there are many examples of undoubtedly
successful introductions by human agency,
quite as many, or perhaps more, unsuccessful ones
might be quoted. In fact, it is by no means easy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
establish a species in any new locality. Frequently
it happens that the species seems to be on the increase
at first, but then there is a decline, and after a few
years the new plantation has entirely vanished. In
other cases, the species disappears immediately after
the introduction takes place, or lingers on for many
years if it receives special and uninterrupted protection.</p>

<p>It may not be generally known that the English
Hare (<i>Lepus Europæus</i>) is not found in Ireland, where
the Mountain Hare (<i>Lepus variabilis</i>) alone occurs.
Attempts to acclimatise the English species have
been made in a number of places in Ireland, but
many of them have been failures, and not one of
them has been a signal success.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Similarly, the
endeavour to introduce the French or Red-legged
Partridge (<i>Caccabis rufa</i>) into Ireland has met with a
like result. According to Dr. Day, it was tried during
the summer of 1869 to naturalise the Sterlet (<i>Acipenser
ruthenus</i>) from Russian waters into the Duke of
Sutherland's River Fleet by importing artificially impregnated
ova. From one hundred and fifty to two
hundred lively young sterlets are said to have been
turned out, but nevertheless the experiment met with
no success. Several fortunately abortive efforts were
also made in British rivers to establish <i>Silurus glanis</i>,
a hideous monster of a fish, and quite unpalatable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p><p>The Natterjack Toad (<i>Bufo calamita</i>) has a very
local distribution in the British Islands. In Ireland
it is found only along the coast of Dingle Bay in
County Kerry, where it is known among the peasantry
as the Black Frog. There is no doubt about its
being indigenous there, and though it has not spread
beyond the very limited area of its habitat, the Irish
climate cannot be said to be unsuited to its existence.
Yet it seems to be extremely difficult to acclimatise
it elsewhere, for though no less than sixty specimens
were turned out in Ph&oelig;nix Park, Dublin, about
forty years ago, none of them were ever seen
afterwards. They were placed in the vicinity of one
of the lakes, so as to give them ample scope for
breeding and developing the young, and in surroundings
which were considered eminently suitable
at the time.</p>

<p>It has occasionally happened, too, that animals are
introduced by kindly-disposed persons with the view
of adding a species to their fauna, in complete
ignorance of their previous existence in the country
where they wished to naturalise them. Thus we are
told that in the year 1699 one of the Fellows of
Trinity College, Dublin, procured Frog's spawn from
England in order to add that amphibian to the Irish
fauna. It was placed in a ditch in the College Park,
whence the species is supposed to have gradually
spread all over the island. This story is quoted by
many writers as the true history of the Frog in
Ireland, and is given as an example of the rapidity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
with which animals spread. Unfortunately the would-be
introducer seemed unaware that, according to
Stuart's <i>History of Armagh</i>, the first Frog which was
ever seen in Ireland made its appearance in a pasture
field near Waterford about the year 1630, that is to
say, seventy years before its introduction in Dublin.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
But even Stuart was mistaken in supposing that no
Frog had ever been seen in Ireland before, since
Giraldus Cambrensis, in his <i>Topography of Ireland</i>,
mentions that a Frog was found in a meadow near
Waterford in the year 1187.</p>

<p>Certain British species of vertebrates are generally
looked upon as introduced species, though we cannot
trace any record of their first establishment, and it is
quite possible that, though there was local extinction
and subsequent local re-introduction, they are truly
indigenous and may never have become totally
extinct. Such are, for instance, the Rabbit (<i>Lepus
cuniculus</i>) and the Pheasant (<i>Phasianus colchicus</i>).
The latter certainly had become naturalised in
England before the Norman invasion.</p>

<p>But cases of introduction such as those above referred
to are by no means confined to the vertebrates,
similar instances among invertebrates being numerous
enough. I am sure every naturalist is personally
acquainted with a good number, and it is hardly
necessary that I should quote in any detail after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
what has been said on the subject generally. The two
species of snails, <i>Helix pomatia</i> and <i>Cyclostoma elegans</i>,
both of which occur in England, and which I had occasion
to mention among those experimented on by
Darwin, were turned out in several suitable localities in
Ireland by Thompson, but failed to establish themselves.
The former, according to Mr. Kew, was also
introduced into Scotland and Norway, whilst fifty or
sixty specimens were brought to Petersfield in England,
but none of these trials at acclimatisation
were successful. As among vertebrates, a large number
of the so-called successful introductions rest upon
insufficient evidence.</p>

<p>When we once more carefully review the evidence
as to the undoubted difficulty attendant on intentional
introduction of animals by human agency, placed as
they often were in most suitable localities, we must
feel that accidental introduction cannot play an important
rôle in the making of the fauna of any country.
Especially is this the case with an island fauna.
Vertebrates are almost altogether excluded, and invertebrates
must arrive singly as a rule, often stranded
on an inhospitable and unsuitable shore. Their
chances of surviving a passage by sea, of finding
suitable food and shelter and a mate in order to procreate
their species, appear to me infinitesimally small.
Yet there may be some such cases. However, I quite
agree with Mr. Andrew Murray&mdash;a high authority
on geographical distribution&mdash;that "colonisation or
occasional dispersal is insufficient to account for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
character of the faunas and floras of oceanic islands;
and I believe that the normal mode in which islands
have been peopled, has been by direct continuity with
the land at some former period, or by contiguity so
close as to be equivalent to junction" (p. 15). "That
a slight intermixture," he continues, "due to Mr.
Darwin's colonisation, occurs in many (probably in
all) I am ready to admit; and from instances to be
afterwards noticed, I am disposed to reckon the proportions
of such intermixtures in the flora, in the
most favourable circumstances, at not more than two
per cent. In the fauna I think it must be much less."</p>

<p>Mr. Murray's views, though they relate only to
oceanic islands, are likewise applicable to continental
islands such as our own. I think we might take the
admixture in the British fauna due to occasional,
including human introduction, as amounting to five
per cent. It is better to take a high estimate, so as to
include all the species about whose native land there
might be some reasonable doubt. Now of what
importance, after all, is this five per cent.? The
remaining ninety-five per cent. of the species of
animals belonging to the British fauna undoubtedly
migrated to these islands in the normal way by land.</p>

<p>It is of great importance, in dealing with the
question of the origin of the British fauna, to
thoroughly grasp this conclusion&mdash;<i>that ninety-five
per cent. of the animals have reached us by land</i>.
We can afford in fact to ignore the five per cent.
altogether. It is an insignificant factor. As regards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
the botanical aspect of the question, botanists are
quite in accord with the zoologists, and entirely
share their views in the belief of a former land-continuity
between the British Islands and the
Continent. "It cannot be denied," says Professor
Blytt (p. 32), "that a plant of one or another
species may, in an exceptional case, migrate, without
human assistance, all at once, across large tracts
of land and sea, and that such migration, if operating
during geological periods, might introduce a number
of species even into distant oceanic islands; but
when the question is of whole communities of plants,
such as the above enumerated elements in our flora,
then such an accidental and sudden transport across
large tracts can only be conceived to be at all
probable in the case of Arctic plants carried by
drifting ice to a bare country without native flora;
as to the other species, we must imagine that the
<i>migration during the gradual change of climate has
proceeded slowly and step by step across connected
tracts of country</i>. In that manner we may assume
that our country has in the course of time obtained
its present covering of plants. Each of the above-named
elements in our flora has doubtless its
corresponding element in our fauna. The fauna
and flora of a region stand in relation of complicated
dependence to each other. The animals
live on the plants. The fecundation of the plants
takes place in a great degree by means of insects;
their seeds are often scattered by resident birds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
quadrupeds. Everything indicates that <i>conveyance
to small distances is the rule</i>, and that sudden and
long migration is the exception."</p>

<p>The conviction which has been gained by zoologists
and botanists, that the British Islands once formed
part of the Continent, is based on the present British
fauna and flora. The remains, however, of animals
which used formerly to live in these countries, such as
the Mammoth, the Irish Elk, the Cave Bear, and many
others, tell us the same tale. They could not have
peopled England by swimming across the Channel,
or even by walking across solid ice, as has once been
suggested. Nothing but a land-connection induced
them to explore this country more closely, and
finally to decide on settling there.</p>

<p>The origin of the British fauna will be discussed
more in detail in the third chapter. The methods
of investigation adopted, along with a general scheme
of this book, will be found in the next.</p>

<p>The manner in which the origin of the fauna of any
particular continental area can be traced is very
similar to that adopted in the case of an island.
Portions of the continent of Europe can be shown
to have been islands in former times. Thus the
Crimea, now a peninsula united to the mainland
by the narrow isthmus of Perekop, must have been
an island in comparatively recent times. The absence
of a number of striking and familiar South Russian
species of mammals and reptiles proves this to have
been the case. It was probably long after the appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>of man, though before historic times, that these
changes took place.</p>

<p>We shall learn in the subsequent chapters, that
by a careful study of the fauna and flora the
fact can be established, not only of the former
connection of an island with a continent, but also
whether such union existed (geologically speaking)
within recent or more remote times. The better
the fauna is known, both recent and fossil, the more
precisely can the period of connection be indicated,
and its duration determined.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.<br />

PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS.</h2>


<p>I intend to give in this chapter a general outline
of the subject which will be discussed in the
subsequent ones. This will include a brief history
of the great events, in recent geological times, which
have modified the evolution of the European fauna
by the influence which they have exerted on the
course of the successive streams of migration.</p>

<p>The composition of the European fauna is the
first item which will have to be taken into consideration.
But not only must the existing species
of animals be dealt with: the extinct ones, too,
at least those which have lived in Europe during
late Tertiary times, will be useful for our inquiries.
A knowledge of the past faunas is a most important
factor in tracing the original home of the European
animals.</p>

<p>Where a species first originated, whether this was
in one or several places, or, in other words, where
it first had its home, cannot be determined with
absolute certainty in the present state of our
knowledge, but as a rule it can be indicated
approximately with a fair amount of precision. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
a few instances, species may possibly have had a
dual origin. The majority of naturalists doubt
that there are any such, but it seems to me
that almost the same forces may have acted in
different localities on certain forms so as to produce,
in very exceptional circumstances, similar species.
The vast majority of animals, however, have no
doubt originated in one locality; or, we might say,
almost all species have but one home.</p>

<p>We may assume that every animal gradually
extends its range by migration, as the result of the
natural increase of the species necessitating a search
for fresh feeding grounds. Every species thus tends
to slowly take possession of all the habitable parts
of the globe to which it has access. They would
all naturally spread from their original homes in
every direction, unless prevented by an impassable
barrier. We have already learned that to all land
animals, the sea acts as such a barrier. Mountains
and rivers act also in a similar way, but not to the
same extent. It is not difficult to understand also
that a forest may be a formidable barrier to a typical
inhabitant of the open country and <i>vice versâ</i>, whilst
a desert is impassable to almost all terrestrial organisms.
Some species are scarcely affected by climate,
and flourish equally well in the tropics and in
temperate or cold countries; the majority, however,
are greatly influenced by it. "No more striking
illustration," remarks Merriam (p. 38), "could be
desired of the potency of climate compared with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the inefficiency of physical barriers, than is presented
by the almost total dissimilarity of the North
American Tropical and Sonoran Regions, though
in direct contact, contrasted with the great similarity
of the Boreal Regions of North America and Eurasia,
now separated by broad oceans, though formerly
united, doubtless, in the region of Behring Sea."</p>

<p>To return to the composition of the European
fauna, we now know positively that a number of the
mammals and birds inhabiting Central and Eastern
Europe are of Siberian origin. How they came, and
when, will form the subject for discussion in Chapter
V. At present it will suffice to mention that in the
superficial deposits belonging to the Pleistocene
series of the North European plain have been discovered
the remains of many typical members of the
Siberian Steppe-fauna. Some of these, such as the
Saiga-Antelope (<i>Saiga tartarica</i>), <a href="#Figure02">Fig. 2</a>, still inhabit
portions of Eastern Europe, whilst others have retreated
to their native land. But it might be asked,
how is it known that these species did not originate
in Europe, and thence migrate to Siberia? Because
if they had originated on our continent, they would
have spread there. They would have invaded
Northern and Southern Europe, and they would
probably have left some remains in Spain, Italy, or
Greece. They would also have left some of their
relations in Europe; but all their nearest allies,
too, are Asiatic. Moreover,&mdash;and this completes, I
think, the proof of their Siberian origin,&mdash;the Pleistocene
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>remains of these animals in Europe become
less abundant, and the number of species likewise
decreases, as we proceed from east to west. With
these remains of Steppe animals are generally associated
those of others, which we must also look upon
as Siberian emigrants, such as the Pikas or tailless
Hares belonging to the genus <i>Lagomys</i>, the pouched
Marmots (<i>Spermophilus</i>), and others. Some of them,
as I have mentioned, still inhabit Central and Eastern
Europe, whilst others have a wider distribution on our
continent.</p>

<p>This migration must have been an unusually large
one. It has been suggested that the Glacial period
had some connection with it, and there can be little
doubt, as we shall see later on, that a change of
climate probably brought about this great Siberian
invasion of Europe. But other causes might tend
in the same direction, such as want of sufficient
food after a few years of great increase of any particular
species. It is not known to what we owe
the periodic visits of the Central Asiatic Sandgrouse
(<i>Syrrhaptes paradoxus</i>), <a href="#Figure03">Fig. 3</a>, but certain it is that
immense flocks of these birds invade Europe from
time to time at the present day, just as those
mammals may have done in past ages.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 3.</span>&mdash;Central Asiatic Sandgrouse (<i>Syrrhaptes paradoxus</i>).</p>

<p>The <i>Siberian</i> migrations will be spoken of in the
subsequent pages, as the Siberian element of the
European fauna. These migrations, however, are not
the only ones which reached Europe from Asia.
The sixth chapter deals with migrations which have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
influenced our fauna far more than the Siberian. The
latter did not last long, nor did they affect the whole
of Europe. But what I may call the <i>Oriental</i> migrations
spread to every corner of Europe and certainly
lasted throughout the whole of the Tertiary Era. The
Oriental element came probably from Central and
Southern Asia, and in its march to Northern Europe
it was joined by local European migrations. For on
our continent, too, animals originated and spread in
all directions from their centres of dispersal. A
separate chapter has been given to the <i>Alpine</i> fauna,
and another to that of South-western Europe, which
will be known by the name of the <i>Lusitanian</i> element.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Finally, animals have also reached us from the north,
and in the fourth chapter the history of that remarkable
migration will be fully discussed under the title
of the <i>Arctic</i> element of the European fauna.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that Africa played an important
rôle in the peopling of our continent, but
this is quite a mistake. The eminent Swiss palæontologist
Rütimeyer was quite right in saying (p.
42) that it is much more probable that Morocco,
Algeria, and Tunis were stocked with animals by way
of Gibraltar, and perhaps also by Sicily and Malta,
from Europe, than the South of Europe from Africa.</p>

<p>I have already referred to what are known as
"centres of dispersion" of animals, but before continuing
to explain the general outline of this book,
it will be necessary to make a few additional remarks
on the subject.</p>

<p>Since every animal naturally tends to spread in
every direction from its original home&mdash;that is to
say, from the place of its origin&mdash;the latter should
correspond with the centre of its range. And in
any particular group of animals the maximum
number of species should be formed in the area or
zone which is the centre of its distribution. In the
great majority of instances this is probably the case,
in the higher animals perhaps less so than in the lower;
still the rule must hold good that the original home
of a species is generally indicated by the centre of
its geographical distribution.</p>

<p>Take for example our familiar Badger (<i>Meles taxus</i>).<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
It inhabits Europe and Northern Asia. It is absent
apparently from many parts of Central Asia, but it
appears again farther south in Palestine, Syria, Persia,
Turkestan, and Tibet. West Central Asia would be
about the centre of its range. That this corresponds
to its place of origin is indicated by the fact that the
only three other Badgers known&mdash;viz., <i>M. anakuma</i>,
<i>M. leucurus</i>, and <i>M. albogularis</i>&mdash;are confined to Asia.
If we examine the fossil history of the genus, we find
that the two most ancient instances of the existence
of Badgers have been discovered in Persia, where <i>M.
Polaki</i> and <i>M. maraghanus</i> occur in miocene deposits.
The latter had migrated as far west as Greece in miocene
times; no other trace of the Badger, however, is
known from Europe until we come to the pleistocene
beds. There are a good many cases known among
mammals where the centre of dispersion would indicate
to us a similar origin. On the other hand, there may
be no fossil evidence of the occurrence of a species,
or of its ancestors, in Asia, whilst such has been
discovered in Europe. I think, however, that the
present range of a species forms a safer criterion for
the determination of its original home, as the Asiatic
continent is still practically unworked from a palæontological
point of view. In a letter which I received
from Professor Charles Depéret, he advocates the
view that the wild Boar (<i>Sus scrofa</i>) is probably of
European, and not, as I maintained (<i>c</i>, p. 455), of
Asiatic origin; because there seemed to be a direct
descent from Hyotherium of the middle miocene of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Europe, through the upper miocene Pig of the Mount
Lebéron (<i>Sus major</i>) and of Eppelsheim (<i>Sus
antiquus</i>), and the pliocene Pigs of Montpellier (<i>Sus
provincialis</i>) and of the Auvergne (<i>Sus arvernensis</i>).
No doubt this appears rather a strong case in favour
of the European origin of the wild Boar, but although
the Tertiary strata of Asia, as I remarked, are as yet
little known, a number of fossil pigs are known from
India, Persia, and China, the oldest being the upper
miocene Persian Pig (<i>Sus maraghanus</i>). Pigs are
therefore as old in Asia as in Europe, and as a direct
intercourse between the two continents probably never
ceased since miocene times, it is not surprising that
this genus should occur in both. Even if the genus had
its origin in Europe, it is quite possible that in later
Tertiary times, the active centre of origin was shifted
to the neighbouring continent, and that henceforth
many new species issued forth from Asia, some of
which may subsequently have been modified on
reaching our continent. The wild Boar (<i>Sus scrofa</i>),
however, to judge from its general range, I must look
upon as merely an immigrant in Europe. I have no
doubt that it originated somewhere in Asia, probably
in the south.</p>

<p>The view I take of the origin of our European
Boar is also supported by Dr. Forsyth Major's recent
researches. He was led to a re-investigation of the
history of the Pig while examining a large number
of fossil skulls in the Museum at Florence, and came
to the conclusion that only three or four species of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
recent wild pigs can be clearly distinguished (<i>b</i>, p. 298).
One of these, viz., <i>Sus vittatus</i>, he thinks, is traceable
in slight modifications from Sardinia to New
Guinea and from Japan to South Africa. The centre
of distribution of this species lies in Southern Asia.
Of the three remaining species, two, viz., <i>Sus verrucosus</i>
and <i>S. barbarus</i>, are entirely confined to the
great islands which form part of the Malay Archipelago.
Finally, <i>Sus scrofa</i>, our Central European
wild Boar, is so closely related to <i>S. vittatus</i> that the
Sardinian Boar might be looked upon as a variety of
either the one or the other. At any rate, Dr. Major
recognises clearly in <i>Sus vittatus</i> the representative
of the ancestral stock of which <i>Sus scrofa</i> is a somewhat
modified offshoot.</p>

<p>The fauna of Europe consists, as I have mentioned,
to a large extent of immigrants from the neighbouring
continents. This is especially noticeable among the
higher animals. When we come to the lower, such as
the amphibia, we find a larger percentage, and among
the land mollusca the great majority, to be of European
origin. The foreigners are, as we learned, called
Orientals, Siberians, and Arctics. For the sake of
convenience, only two of the great European centres
of origin have a chapter devoted to themselves,
namely, the Alpine and the Lusitanian centres.
There is another, however, of almost equal importance
which lies in the east.</p>

<p>In the British Islands there is only an exceedingly
small and insignificant group of species which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
peculiar, and which we may consider to have had
their origin there. Almost the whole of the British
fauna is composed of streams of migrants which came
from the north, south, and east, though many of
these immigrant species have since their arrival been
more or less distinctly modified into varieties or local
races.</p>

<p>The eminent French conchologist Bourguignat (<i>a</i>, p.
352) was of opinion that, as far as terrestrial mollusca
were concerned, there are in Europe three principal
centres of creation or dispersion&mdash;all situated in
mountainous countries and not in the plains. He
distinguished the Spanish, Alpine, and Tauric centres,
and believed that almost all species known from
Europe had originated in one of these three, and that
each of them possessed quite a distinct type of its
own. This theory seems to agree very well with the
facts of distribution. Let us take, for instance, the
genus <i>Clausilia</i>, a pretty turret-shaped snail, which
abounds on old ruined walls. Only two species, viz.,
<i>Cl. laminata</i> and <i>Cl. bidentata</i>, are met with in Ireland.
In England we find the same species with the addition
of two others, <i>Cl. biplicata</i> and <i>Cl. Rolphii</i>. Crossing
over the Channel to Belgium, these four species occur
again, and also several others not known in England.
In Germany the list of <i>Clausiliæ</i> mounts up to twenty-five
species, including all those found in the British
Islands. As we proceed eastward the number of
species of this genus increases steadily, and when we
reach the Caucasus or the Balkan Peninsula the conchologist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>is able to make a collection of several
hundred different kinds, whilst farther east again they
diminish. This clearly indicates there is in South-Eastern
Europe a powerful centre of creation of
<i>Clausiliæ</i>, from which the species have spread all
over Europe. But it is by no means certain that this
centre was always in our continent, for in South-Eastern
Asia and the Malay Archipelago <i>Clausiliæ</i>
increase once more. It is interesting to note, however,
that almost all these eastern forms belong to the sub-genus
<i>Phædusa</i> (<i>vide</i> Boettger), which had only been
known as a fossil genus from a few species in the
Eocene and Oligocene of Southern Europe. The
first centre of origin, therefore, may possibly have
been in Southern Asia, and in these early Tertiary
times a second centre may have become established
in Southern Europe from which the sub-genus <i>Garnieria</i>
went eastward, <i>Macroptychia</i> southward, and
<i>Nenia</i> westward across the Atlantic to South America.
Only a few remnants of these primitive <i>Clausiliæ</i>
are now left in Europe, such as the interesting <i>Cl.
(Laminifera) Pauli</i>.</p>

<p>As an example of a genus which has its centre of
distribution in South-Western Europe we might take
that to which our common brown garden slug belongs,
viz., <i>Arion</i>. Dr. Simroth, who was the first to point
out that the species of <i>Arion</i> had spread over our continent
from South-Western Europe (p. 5), is inclined
to the belief that the <i>Arionidæ</i> had originated on the
old land-bridge between Europe and North America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
which is generally known by the name of "Atlantis."
From this a branch went westward to the New
World and another eastward as far as Southern Asia,
but <i>Arion</i> and a number of other genera are more or
less confined to South-Western Europe. Only a few
species of <i>Arion</i> have a wide range in Europe, one of
them, <i>A. subfuscus</i>, crossing the borders of our continent
into Siberia. In the British Islands and in
Western Germany, which are about equi-distant from
the supposed creative centre of the genus, there are
found five species. In France six or seven species
are met with, and in Spain and Portugal about ten.
Towards the east, <i>Arions</i> diminish in number. This
genus, therefore, forms part of a migration which I
have designated as "Lusitanian" from <i>Lusitania</i>,
the name applied by the Romans to what we
now call Portugal. Another genus of slugs, <i>Geomalacus</i>,
is interesting from the fact that one species
occurs in the British Islands, being otherwise confined
to the Lusitanian province. Parmacella, a slug-like
animal bearing a tiny shell at the extremity of its
tail, has probably likewise had its origin in this part of
Europe. All this, however, will be more fully referred
to in the seventh chapter, which deals with the
Lusitanian fauna.</p>

<p>As regards the Alpine centre of origin, Dr. Kobelt
considers three groups of mollusca as especially
characteristic of the Alps, viz., the sub-genus <i>Campylaea</i>
of the great and widely-spread genus <i>Helix</i>, and the
genera <i>Pomatias</i> and <i>Zonites</i>. The latter, which is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
to be confounded with our British <i>Hyalinia</i> (formerly
united with <i>Zonites</i>), does not extend very far south
or north of the Alps. There may be others too, which
owe their origin to these mountains, but most of
the terrestrial mollusca are exceedingly ancient, and
many genera have existed long before the Alps had
made their appearance above the surface of the early
Tertiary seas. It should be remembered that <i>Hyalinia</i>
and <i>Pupa</i>, both British genera, are known from
carboniferous deposits in forms which closely approach
those living at the present day, and in these and a
great number of other instances, it is quite impossible
to determine the original home of the genus.</p>

<p>This little digression on centres of dispersion will
help us to understand in what manner the indigenous
element of the European fauna joined in with the
alien members as they arrived in our continent. The
species confined to South-Eastern England need not
necessarily have come to us from Eastern Europe or
Siberia. Alpine species spread northward probably
at the same time as the Siberian animals went westward.
An Alpine form may therefore have joined a
batch of the latter and entered England with them.
Even a Lusitanian animal may have mingled with
these migrants, so that all three elements may occur
together in one locality.</p>

<p>But these are exceptions. The migrations have, as
a rule, not joined to any great extent; indeed, all
those naturalists who have carefully examined the
problem of the origin of the European fauna, have felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
that it was composed of elements which arrived at
different times.</p>

<p>The great Russian naturalist, the late Professor
Brandt, distinguished five phases in the history of the
Eurasian mammalian fauna (pp. 249-254). During the
first phase&mdash;an uncertain period of long duration&mdash;the
mammals held intact their position in the northern
half of Asia. The Mammoth, the Hairy Rhinoceros,
Bison, Musk Ox, Wild Sheep, Reindeer, and perhaps
Tigers, Hyænas, etc., lived then, with numerous
peculiar Rodents, under such climatic conditions,
according to Brandt, that they were able to extend
their range along with tree vegetation to the extreme
north of the Asiatic continent. This, he thinks, seems
to have been the case especially with the Reindeer,
Mammoth, Rhinoceros, and Musk Ox. The second
phase was characterised by the dispersion of the
Northern Asiatic mammalian fauna towards Central,
Southern, and Western Europe, and this period lasted
until the complete extermination of the Mammoth.
The third phase dates from the time when the Mammoth
and the Hairy Rhinoceros had become extinct,
whilst the fourth commenced with the disappearance
of the Reindeer in Europe, and terminated when the
Wild Ox in the feral state had become unknown.
Finally, the last phase constitutes the present time.
Lartet held similar views, and also believed that
Europe was peopled by successive migrations from
Asia.</p>

<p>Botanists have worked at the problem of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
European flora much more systematically, and our
knowledge of the origin of that flora has been greatly
increased within the last twenty years, chiefly by
the researches of Professor Engler. More recently,
detailed studies have been made in Scandinavia by
Professor Blytt, in the Alps by Dr. Christ and Mr.
Ball, in Germany by Professor Drude, Dr. Schulz,
and many others. Dr. Schulz (p. 1) is of opinion
that the great majority of the European plants have
either migrated to or have originated in our continent
since the beginning of the Pliocene epoch, and
that the original home of the immigrants must be
looked for in Asia and in Arctic America. From the
latter an almost uninterrupted migration must have
taken place during the greater part of Tertiary times
up to the commencement of the Pliocene epoch, partly
over a direct land-connection with Europe by way of
Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroes, and also <i>viâ</i>
Spitsbergen, Franz Josef Land and Novaya Zemlya,
and partly by an indirect one across the Behring
Straits between Alaska and Kamtchatka.</p>

<p>A good deal of work still requires to be done before
zoologists have acquired the same intimacy with the
European fauna as botanists have with the flora.
However, the view that our animals all come from
Asia, as was long ago believed, has been abandoned
for some time. The first to bring under the notice
of naturalists the hypothesis, that there must have
been two distinct migrations of northern animals to
Central Europe&mdash;one from the north, and another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
from the east&mdash;was the late Mr. Bogdanov. The
Arctic species, of which remains have been discovered
in the Pyrenees&mdash;namely, the Reindeer, Arctic Hare,
Willow Grouse, etc., he thought had nothing to do
with those which invaded Europe from Siberia during
the Glacial period. He maintained that the former
had quite a distinct origin, and came from Scandinavia
(p. 26).</p>

<p>As I shall deal with this problem more fully in a
subsequent chapter, I need only mention that I fully
agree with the view expressed by Mr. Bogdanov that
two distinct migrations of northern species to Central
Europe can be traced.</p>

<p>No one, I think, has done more in fostering a careful
study of the migrations of animals than our
distinguished geologist Professor Boyd Dawkins. He
did not follow Bogdanov in distinguishing two Arctic
migrations; however, he did more in constructing a
very ingenious chart (<i>a</i>, p. 111) representing the geography
of Europe during the last and most recent
geological epoch&mdash;the Pleistocene&mdash;and indicating on
it the probable extent, during that time, of an eastern
and a southern migration of mammals. The map is
very instructive, and is the first ever published giving
a clear idea of a southern and an eastern migration
to Europe. He believed that the migration of the
southern mammals northward, took place conjunctly
with the westward movement of the eastern species.
Having once reached Europe, the southern species
are supposed to have passed northward in summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
time, whilst the eastern forms (he calls them northern)
would swing southwards. The two migrations would
thus occupy, at different times of the year, the
same tract of ground (<i>a</i>, p. 113). From the mingling
of the remains of the Hyæna with those of the
Reindeer and Hippopotamus in the Kirkdale Cavern,
he infers that the former preyed upon the Reindeer
at one time of the year, and on the Hippopotamus at
another. He argues that in such a manner might
be explained the curious mixture of northern and
southern types which we find in the British pleistocene
and in cave deposits.</p>

<p>Besides mammals, the only European animals
which have received some attention with a view to a
study of their origin, are the Butterflies and the Land-Snails.
The entomologists who have taken up the
problem have in so far scarcely produced satisfactory
results, as they all seemed to be bound down to the
hypothesis that practically all the butterflies had
been destroyed in Europe during the Glacial period.
Hofman, in his interesting little work, comes to the
conclusion (p. 50), that only in Greece and Spain
could a small remnant of the butterflies have survived
the extreme rigours of climate. Greece was at that
time connected with Asia Minor, and Spain with
North Africa; and the author supposes that the semi-alien
fauna inhabiting these tracts was mainly responsible
for the re-stocking of Southern Europe, but
that the main mass of our butterflies are post-glacial
Siberian immigrants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p><p>The work published by Messrs. Speyer deals only
with the origin of the Central European Butterflies.
The period during which our European species
originated is not specified, but the authors believe
that they had their home either in Southern Russia
or Central Asia. The fact that the number of
butterflies decreases very considerably as we proceed
north-westward in Europe appears to them
to substantiate these views. The apparent dislike
evinced by butterflies to the damp Atlantic Coast
climate, they think, clearly indicates that they had
originated in a dry and more continental climate.
The history of the North European Butterflies
and Moths has been carefully described by Mr.
Petersen. He adopts Hofman's theory as to the
almost total extinction of the Lepidoptera in
Europe during the Glacial period. The chief immigration
to Europe after that period is, he thinks,
Siberian.</p>

<p>At first there appeared species which belonged
to a cold climate, and which now live in elevated
regions; then came forms suited to a milder
climate, which established themselves on the north-easterly
slopes of the Alps. The most recent addition
which our continent has received from Siberia is,
according to Mr. Petersen, the present Scandinavian
fauna. Scandinavia has obtained a larger number of
species than the European plain, because to this last
migration were added such as prefer a northern or
Alpine climate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p><p>As a contribution to the history and composition of
the European fauna, by far the most important work
ever published is that of Dr. Kobelt, the eminent
German conchologist. Whilst the researches into the
origin of the Lepidoptera, above described, have been
marred by the prevalent prejudice as to the deleterious
effects of a glacial climate on the butterflies,
the present author boldly works out the problem on
independent lines. He shuns theories and speculations
almost altogether. His great work, as yet
practically unknown, the result of a lifetime of the
most painstaking labour, ranks among the most important
contributions to zoogeography. I shall have
frequent occasion to refer to it throughout these pages.
Meanwhile some of his more remarkable conclusions
may be mentioned. "Comparing all classes of
animals as to their zoogeographical importance, the
highest rank must undoubtedly be accorded to the
land-snails" (i., p. 7). "The Pleistocene, and with it
the land and fresh-water molluscan fauna of the
present day has been gradually evolved from the
Tertiary one, and its roots can be traced through the
Cretaceous to the Jurassic epoch. During the whole
of that time no sudden appearance of a new fauna
can be demonstrated. Quite slowly, step by step, the
Cretaceous is succeeded by the Tertiary fauna, and
one after the other of the characteristic palæarctic
genera appear&mdash;first the fresh-water, then the land
forms" (p. 141). "The division of the North Alpine
from the South Alpine fauna must be older than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
Glacial period; and the present Central European
fauna had already become developed from the Pliocene
<i>in all its details of form and distribution</i> before
the commencement of the Ice Age" (p. 162). "We
must draw the conclusion from the preceding remarks,
that the present (palæarctic) molluscan fauna in its
distribution is older than the Glacial period, and that
the latter produced merely a retreat of the fauna
from the most inhospitable regions of Europe with
a subsequent re-immigration, but did not cause its
destruction" (i., p. 169).</p>

<p>A few attempts have also been made by naturalists
to trace the origin of the fauna of some smaller
European areas. Thus Rütimeyer, in dealing with
the mammalian fauna of Switzerland, remarks (p. 31)
"that it seems certain that, in spite of many local
disturbances, the continuity of generations was never
interrupted throughout the whole of the Tertiary
period until the present day."</p>

<p>An even more interesting memoir is that of Mr.
Köppen on the origin of the Crimean fauna. It is
only recently, according to this author, that this peninsula
has become connected with Southern Russia.
And it is for this reason that the Squirrel and a number
of other animals, and also plants, present in Russia,
are absent from the Crimea. Originally the latter probably
formed a westward continuation of the Caucasus,
and at that time it was surrounded by the sea on
all other sides. "Much later," he continues, "after
and in consequence of a local subsidence, the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
between the Caucasus and the Crimea became
interrupted. The latter existed for a long time as
an island, and only much later, in recent geological
times, did it become united with Southern Russia
by means of the isthmus of Perekop."</p>

<p>There is, on the whole, a great diversity of opinion
as to how the European fauna has originated; however,
except in Dr. Kobelt's work, no attempt has
hitherto been made to collect together all the available
information, and to include in the inquiry more than
one class of animals. The little work which I venture
to bring before the public will not by any means exhaust
the subject, nor is our knowledge of the European
fauna sufficient to give more than a mere sketch
of many of the animal groups mentioned. As we
have learned in the introduction, different classes of
animals are not all of equal importance in indicating
the changes which have taken place in the distribution
of land and water. While Dr. Kobelt is of opinion
that the land-snails are by far the most important
in such an inquiry, Mr. Lydekker believes that
mammals afford the safest and truest indications
of such changes. Mr. Beddard puts in a claim for
earthworms, as even a narrow strait of sea-water
forms an insuperable barrier to their dispersion.
Dr. Wallace agrees with Mr. Lydekker, and goes
so far as to say (p. 74) that "whenever we find
that a considerable number of the mammals of two
countries exhibit distinct marks of relationship, we
may be sure that an actual land-connection, or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
all events an approach to within a very few miles
of each other, has at one time existed." Besides
the groups referred to, I claim that particular
attention should be devoted to Amphibia, which,
contrary to Wallace, I hold do not possess special
facilities for dispersal; and also to spiders and to
all wingless animals leading a subterranean life, such
as some of the wood-lice, planarian worms and
apterous beetles.</p>

<p>A thorough knowledge of the changes in the distribution
of land and water is desirable in order to
appreciate the extent and variations of former migrations.
A study of the British fauna, for example,
teaches us that the British Islands were once connected
with one another and with the continent of
Europe between England and France. It was
Professor James Geikie, I believe, who first pointed
out, many years ago, that the area now covered by
the Irish Sea was formerly in all probability a fresh-water
lake. This had its outlet at the southern extremity
in the form of a stream into which most likely
flowed the smaller rivers from the south-east of
Ireland, and which was joined from the east by the
Severn, and finally debouched into the Atlantic
(<a href="#Figure04">Fig. 4</a>). The range in the British Islands of those
species which have migrated to them from the south,
indicates that whilst the Atlantic Ocean had gradually
crept up and flooded the area between Ireland and
Wales, and had turned the fresh-water lake into a bay,
communication between Scotland and Ireland was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
still possible. The occurrence of many Scandinavian
species in Scotland which are absent on the continent
of Europe, indicates that these two countries also
were united formerly. Most geologists hold that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
a connection, if it existed, must have broken down
in Pliocene times. Professor Judd, however, has expressed
his belief (p. 1008) that it still existed until
after the appearance of man in Northern Europe, and
that our forefathers might have been able to walk
dry foot from Scotland to Norway.</p>

when the earlier members of the southern migration reached
England. (Only some of the rivers have been indicated. The
shaded parts represent water, the light land.)</p>

<p>I shall also show on distributional evidence, in the
fourth chapter, that until recent geological times
Scandinavia was continued northward, by way of
Bear Island, with Spitsbergen and probably Franz
Josef Land, which islands again were joined with
North Greenland and Arctic North America, and
that the polar fauna and flora were able to spread on
this land-connection to both America and Europe.</p>

<p>That Gibraltar was connected with Morocco, and
Sicily with Southern Italy and Greece on the one
hand, and with Tunis on the other, is more generally
recognised; whilst Professor Suess has shown (vol. i.,
p. 442), on purely geological grounds, that the
Egean Sea was dry land up till quite recently&mdash;certainly,
he thinks, till after the appearance of man.
This supposition enables us to understand, as will be
more fully discussed in the sixth chapter, how the
Oriental fauna entered Europe. Such minor zoogeographical
problems as the occurrence of the Wild
Goat of Asia Minor (<i>Capra ægagrus</i>) on the islands of
Crete and on some of the Cyclades now almost
explain themselves. The Sea of Marmora is probably
a modern formation, so that Asia Minor extended
not long ago beyond the Turkish capital, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Dr. Kobelt believes that an arm of the Black Sea
communicated up till recent times along the lower
course of the Maritza with the Gulf of Saros.
It can be shown also that Sardinia and Corsica
formed part of the continent of Europe, and that
their present fauna and flora reached them by migration
on land.</p>

<p>The Russian naturalists, Brandt and Köppen, believed
that at no very distant date a sea extended right
across Eastern Russia from the Caspian to the Arctic
Ocean, whilst Professor Boyd Dawkins expressed
himself in very similar language as follows (<i>c</i>, p. 35):
"Before the lowering of the temperature in Central
Europe the sea had already rolled through the low
country of Russia, from the Caspian to the White
Sea and the Baltic, and formed a barrier to western
migration to the Arctic mammals of Asia." These
naturalists based their opinions on distributional
evidence, but additional facts will be brought
forward in the fifth chapter to substantiate these
views.</p>

<p>These are some of the more important geographical
events which will be dealt with in detail in the subsequent
chapters in connection with the history of the
migrations of the European fauna.</p>

<p>A separate chapter has been devoted to the British
fauna and its origin, since it plays a very important
part in the evolution of that of our continent. So
essential is a thorough knowledge of this fauna, that
I think it would be difficult to understand, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
it, the main features of the great migrations; and I
have before now expressed the opinion that the
British fauna forms the key to the solution of the
problem of the origin of European animals. We
know that our British species came to us by land&mdash;at
least the bulk of them. But we want to
know what direction they came from, and at what
time they arrived. When Ireland became disconnected
from Great Britain, and the latter from
Scandinavia and France, is another interesting
problem. Professor Boyd Dawkins has indicated
to us a method of the special line of research to
meet such inquiries. "The absence," he says (<i>b</i>,
p. xxix), "of the beaver and the dormouse from Ireland
must be due to the existence of some barrier
to their westward migration from the adjacent mainland,
and the fact that the Alpine hare is indigenous,
while the common hare is absent, implies
that, so far as relates to the former animal, the barrier
did not exist."</p>

<p>Many members of the great Siberian invasion
reached England, but Ireland remained entirely
free from these migrants. The assumption therefore
seems not unreasonable, that the latter country
at the time of their arrival was no longer joined
to England. The great bulk of the Irish fauna
is composed of Lusitanian, Alpine, and Oriental
immigrants, and there is besides a distinctly Arctic or
North American element. All these, of course, must
have established themselves in Ireland before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Siberian fauna set foot in England, since it has been
shown that a continuous land-surface was necessary
for their migration. Owing to the perfect preservation
of the remains of the Siberian migrants in recent
continental deposits, the history of that migration
can be clearly followed, and it is possible even to
determine the date of its arrival in England&mdash;in
geological language at any rate. The time of the
colonisation of Ireland can be thus approximately
fixed as having taken place at a period prior to the
arrival of the Siberian migrants in England.</p>

<p>All those who have seriously studied the problems
presented by our British fauna&mdash;notably the late
Professor Forbes, and more recently Mr. Carpenter
and myself&mdash;are agreed that the Lusitanian element
is the oldest, and that the newest is that which has
come to us from the east.</p>

<p>The sequence of events in the British Islands was
probably as follows:&mdash;The first comers were the
members of that fauna which issued from South-western
Europe; then came the Alpine, and at the
same time probably the Arctic and the Oriental;
and finally the Eastern or Siberian. The migrations
of all but the last continued, uninterruptedly, for very
long periods.</p>

<p>The study of these migrations has convinced me
that, though climate was a powerful factor in the
evolution or history of the European fauna, the
geographical changes which took place on our continent
in later Tertiary times exerted a yet stronger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
influence. The principal climatic disturbance is
generally supposed to have been the so-called "Ice
Age." So firmly rooted is the conviction, among
naturalists of the present day, of the enormous
destruction which this period produced on our
European fauna, so that all animal life practically
disappeared from large areas of our continent, that
it is desirable that we should now shortly review
the history of that remarkable period in order to
ascertain in how far these views are corroborated
by facts. Frequent reference, moreover, will be
made throughout this work to the theories connected
with the Glacial period.</p>

<p>It has been stated by an eminent geologist that
during part of the Glacial period the climate was such
that neither plants nor animals could have existed in
the British Islands. If that had been so, it is evident
that very few organisms could have even survived in
France, though a number of Arctic species might
have dragged on an existence in Southern Europe.
At any rate, on the return of more genial conditions,
the Arctic species would undoubtedly have been the
first to gain admission to the British Islands, to
re-people the arid wastes. Our supposition that the
Lusitanian element in the British fauna is the oldest
would therefore be wrong. From early Tertiary
times onward, the climate of Europe, which was
then semi-tropical, gradually became more and more
temperate; until finally the Ice Age or Glacial
period arrived, during which, according to Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
J. Geikie&mdash;one of our highest authorities on this
subject&mdash;a great part of Northern Europe became
practically uninhabitable owing to the severity of
the climate.</p>

<p>To enable us to judge better of the true value of
the many hypotheses which have been advanced
to account for this supposed extraordinary fall of
temperature during the "Ice Age," we must compare
the views of other authorities with the one just
quoted. I do not propose to discuss the causes which
have led to the production of the Glacial period&mdash;those
interested in these questions should consult
the writings of Dr. Croll, Professor J. Geikie, Professor
Bonney, Mr. Falsan, and others&mdash;but merely to
give the climatic aspects from a physical, zoological,
and botanical point of view.</p>

<p>According to Professor Penck (<i>a</i>, p. 12), the nature
of the glacial climate can be determined by comparing
the snow-line of the Glacial period with that of the
present day. The position of the snow-line is dependent
on two climatic factors&mdash;viz., precipitation
and temperature. We know the height at which
snow must have lain permanently during the Glacial
period, or during the maximum phase of glaciation.
If the Ice Age had been produced solely by an
increase of snowfall, as has been suggested, Professor
Penck tells us that then it must have snowed three or
four times as much as it does now. But he does not
adopt the view that the Ice Age is due to an increase
of snowfall alone. His calculations, based upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
height of the snow-line, tend to show that a general
decrease of temperature to the extent of from 4-5
degrees Centigrade (all other atmospheric conditions
remaining the same as now) would be sufficient to
give us back the Glacial period.</p>

<p>Professor Neumayr (p. 619) adopted a similar principle
in determining the temperature which prevailed
in Europe during the Glacial period. Snow now lies
in the Pyrenees 1000 metres higher than it did then,
1,200 metres higher in the Alps, and 800 metres
higher in the Tatra mountains. Since the temperature
in Central Europe decreases by half a degree
Centigrade for every 100 metres of elevation, it follows
that if the glacial phenomena had only been brought
about by a decrease of temperature without an increase
of moisture, we should have had a reduction
of temperature during the Glacial period of six
degrees Centigrade in the Pyrenees, of seven degrees
in the Alps, and of four in the Tatra mountains.
The general lowering of the temperature of Europe,
says Professor Neumayr, could not have amounted to
more than six degrees Centigrade. Moreover, he is
of opinion that the very low snow-line in the British
Islands proves that even during the Ice Age a comparatively
mild climate prevailed there, and that
the climatic conditions generally, in the different
parts of Europe, were relatively about the same as
they are now.</p>

<p>Professor J. Geikie does not give us his views as to
the temperature of the Glacial period, but he maintains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>that a lowering of the temperature is evinced
not only by the widespread phenomena of glaciation,
but by the former presence in our temperate latitudes
of a northern fauna and flora.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Martins, who based his calculations
on the temperature during the Glacial period on
the glaciers of Chamounix, concluded that it only
needed a lowering of the temperature to the extent
of four degrees Centigrade to bring the glaciers down
to the plain of Geneva, and in fact give us back the
Glacial period. It need not surprise us, therefore,
that the French geologist, Mr. Falsan, the author
of <i>La période glacière</i>, is of opinion (p. 230) that the
mean annual temperature of France during the
Glacial period was approximately from 6-9 degrees
Centigrade, perhaps more. Close to the immense
glaciers of the Rhone, it might have been about
six degrees. This is the actual mean annual temperature
of the South-west of Sweden and Norway, or
the North of Scotland.</p>

<p>Although all these investigations tend to show
that the climate of Europe during the Glacial period
was by no means so severe as we are often led to
believe, yet there exists also a school of geologists
who maintain there was actually a higher temperature
than at present. The inconsistency of mentioning
heat in connection with ice and snow is more
apparent, however, than real, for we must remember
Tyndall's original remark on this subject. It is the
snow, he says, which feeds the glaciers. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
snow comes from the clouds, and these again
originate from the vapours which the sun causes
to be absorbed from the ocean. Without the sun's
heat, we should have no water vapour in the
atmosphere; without vapour, no clouds; without
clouds, no snow; without snow, no glaciers. The
ice of glaciers, therefore, owes its origin indirectly
to the sun's heat. It has been supposed that if the
sun's heat diminished, larger glaciers would form
than those existing to-day, but the diminution of the
solar heat would infallibly reduce the amount of
water vapour in the air, and would thus stop the
very source of glaciers.</p>

<p>Mr. Falsan even admits that without a change of
the mean annual temperature (p. 201) of Europe,
the central portions of our continent might at this
period have enjoyed an insular climate. This more
equable and humid climate could, within certain
limits, favour the development of the ancient glaciers
by increasing the snowfall and slackening the summer
rate of melting.</p>

<p>It seems evident then, according to these views,
that with a comparatively slight change of the
atmospheric conditions in the British Islands, we
might have glaciers back again on all our highest
mountain ranges in England, Scotland, and Ireland.
But a widespread belief seems to prevail that the
presence of glaciers implies a very low temperature.
Snow and ice, however, are formed as soon as the
temperature falls below freezing point; it does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
matter whether there be 1 or 20 degrees of cold.
Winters with a few degrees of frost will be just as
favourable for the growth of glaciers as winters with
the most severe cold.</p>

<p>Let us now see what the fauna and flora, as far
as we know it, tell us of the climate of the Glacial
period. At the very outset of our inquiry we are
confronted with one very serious difficulty in the
problem, and that is the supposed occurrence of inter-glacial
mild phases alternating with colder ones during
the Ice Age. At first, when traces of a temperate flora
and fauna were discovered intercalated between two
layers of boulder clay, their presence was explained
by the supposition of a mild inter-glacial period.
The famous Forest-bed on the east coast of England
was also pronounced to be an inter-glacial deposit,
though not coming precisely under this definition.
In a few places one such bed was found, in some two
or more, and in others none at all. Professor James
Geikie discovered the evidences of no less than five
of such inter-glacial epochs (p. 612) in Europe.
Lest a reader of that author's remarkable work on
the Ice Age might carry with him the idea that his
hypotheses had met with general acceptance, a few
quotations from almost equally high authorities on
glacial matters will be useful. "That the glaciers,"
remarks Professor Bonney (p. 245), "were liable to
important oscillations seems to be proved, but whether
the evidence suffices to establish inter-glacial epochs,
in the usual sense of the words, is more doubtful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
When the snow-fields, as in the Alps, were much
more extensive than they are at present, the glaciers
which radiated from them would be more sensitive
to minor climatal change. Even now they oscillate
considerably. But during a Glacial epoch, an inch,
either more or less, of precipitation might mean a
considerable advance or retreat of the ice in the lowlands."
French geologists look with even less favour
on Professor Geikie's theories. Mr. Falsan (p. 212)
says that he agrees with Messrs. Favre, de Saporta,
Lory, de Mortillet, Desor, de Lapparent, Lortet,
Chantre, Benoit, Fontannes, Depéret, and many
other geologists, that there was only a single Glacial
period, which, according to each particular region,
might be divided into several phases, or into their
equivalents&mdash;viz., one or more extensions of the
ancient glaciers. But, on the whole, the view that
there was at least one inter-glacial phase in the
Glacial period meets with more general acceptance
among geologists, I think, though the other opinion
agrees much better with the nature of the fauna
and flora as it has been revealed to us from the
pleistocene deposits.</p>

<p>The occurrence of the remains of such arctic species
of mammals as the Musk-Ox, Arctic Fox, Glutton,
Lemming, and many others in these deposits, is
frequently held up to us by geologists as a proof
of the prevalence of an arctic climate while these
beds were laid down. And indeed this appears
at first a most satisfactory explanation of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
phenomenon. But we must not judge the climate
of Europe by their presence alone. As I shall
explain more fully in Chapter V., these species
invaded Europe owing to two circumstances. Firstly,
because the climate of Siberia was becoming colder,
necessitating a southward movement, with a consequent
over-population in a reduced area; secondly,
because a new short route to Europe had been
opened up for them about the same time (see
p. <a href="#Page_221">221</a>). An invasion of Europe therefore took place
from east to west. Similar invasions occur even at
the present day, though not caused by a change in
our climate, for every now and then immense flocks
of the Siberian Sandgrouse emigrate to our continent.
The mammalian migrants referred to are not to be
looked upon as constituting the whole of our fauna
at that time. Europe had a fauna of its own, and
these invaders merely mingled with our animals.
There was, no doubt, a keen struggle for existence,
as the result of which the weaker in many cases
succumbed. The hypothesis, however, that these
Siberian migrants occupied an empty continent,
forsaken by its pre-glacial inhabitants, is not supported
by any facts.</p>

<p>All those who have investigated the pleistocene
fauna have been struck by the extraordinary mixture
of northern and southern types of animals. Professor
Dawkins attempted to explain these facts by the supposition
(p. 113) that "in the summer time the southern
species would pass northwards, and in the winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
time the northern would sway southwards, and thus
occupy at different times of the year the same
tract of ground, as is now the case with the elks
and reindeer." "In some of the caverns," he
continues (p. 114), "such as that of Kirkdale, the
hyæna preyed upon the reindeer at one time of the
year, and the hippopotamus at another."</p>

<p>A similar mingling of northern and southern
faunas has also been observed in France. Mr.
Falsan tells us (p. 236), that the remains of the
mammals gathered and determined by Lartet and
Gaudry belong partly to species which have been
wrongly regarded as indications of a severe climate,
and partly to such as are accustomed to a relatively
mild temperature. In several localities in France,
viz., at Levallois, St. Acheul, and Arcy, the remains of
the Hippopotamus have occurred together with those
of the Reindeer; whilst, according to Sir H. Howorth,
the Lion has been found together with northern Voles
at Bicêtre, near Paris. It is stated by the same
authority (p. 115) that much the same conditions
exist in Germany. "The lion and the spotted hyæna,
the mammoth and rhinoceros, were found with the
marmot, the suslik, the lemming, the pica, and the
reindeer." At another locality near Thiede, remains
of the Mammoth, woolly Rhinoceros, Horse, Ox,
Reindeer, Arctic Fox, Lemming, and Pica are met
with in the same deposit. In quoting the presence
of these northern animals in Europe as evidence of an
arctic climate, we commit a fatal mistake. Indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
breeders of animals and those acquainted with zoological
gardens know perfectly well that it is much
easier to keep a northern species in a southern
climate, than a southern species in a northern one.
If in a Central European deposit occur a mixture of
northern and southern forms of animals, the presence
of the latter is more remarkable than that of the
former. Logically, we should look upon the occurrence
of southern species in the north, therefore, as supporting
the view that a mild climate had induced them
to travel northward. The only indication, indeed,
of the presence of a Monkey in the British Isles
in former times comes to us from the very same
strata which have also yielded the remains of the
Siberian mammals.</p>

<p>Before I conclude the consideration of the pleistocene
fauna, it may be of interest to hear what
Mr. Lydekker, one of our highest authorities
on fossil mammals, has to say on this subject.
"The most remarkable feature connected with
this fauna is the apparently contradictory evidence
which it affords as to the nature of the climate
then prevalent. The Glutton, Reindeer, Arctic
Fox, and Musk-Ox are strongly indicative of
a more or less arctic climate; many of the Voles
(<i>Microtus</i>), Picas (<i>Lagomys</i>), and Susliks (<i>Spermophilus</i>),
together with the Saiga Antelope,
appear to point equally strongly to the prevalence
of a Steppe-like condition; while the Hippopotamus
and Spotted Hyæna seem as much in favour of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
sub-tropical state of things. Many attempts have
been made to reconcile these apparently contradictory
circumstances; one of the older views being
that while the tropical types of animals lived during
a warm interlude, they migrated southwards with
the incoming of colder conditions to the arctic type
of fauna. Since, however, it has now been ascertained
that the remains of both tropical and arctic forms
have been found lying side by side in the same bed,
it is perfectly certain that such an explanation will
not meet the exigencies of the case" (p. 300).</p>

<p>In Germany the remains of the Siberian mammals
occur to a large extent in a pleistocene deposit known
as "loess," and the theory has of late years gained
ground that the latter is the fine dust-like sand
accumulated during an intensely arctic dry climate.
That many of the mammals discovered in the "loess"
now inhabit the dry steppes of Eastern Europe and
North-Western Asia seems to lend support to this
supposition; but besides the mammals there are also
land and freshwater shells in this deposit. The molluscan
fauna certainly indicates no steppe-character,
according to Dr. Kobelt (<i>b</i>, i. p. 166).</p>

<p>The attempt to utilise the Siberian migrants to
Europe as indicators of a severe climate there, certainly
fails to establish conviction. But it may be
asked, surely the remains of the Alpine and Arctic
plants which have been found in pleistocene deposits
must decide this question in favour of one or the
other hypothesis? Let us test it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p><p>Plants being more directly affected than animals
by changes of temperature and rainfall, remarks
Mr. Clement Reid (p. 185), give evidence of the
highest value when we inquire into former climatic
conditions. The severity of the climate during the
Glacial period is often assumed from the occurrence
in pleistocene strata of such plants as <i>Dryas octopetala</i>,
some species of willow, the dwarf birch, and others,
which are now found in high latitudes and in the Alps,
but are, as a rule, absent from the plain of Northern
Europe. Professor J. Geikie goes so far as to state
(p. 398) that it was unlikely that southern England
during the climax of the glacial cold had much if any
vegetation to boast of, and continues, "It is certain,
however, that it was clothed and peopled by an Arctic
flora and fauna when the climatic conditions were
somewhat less severe, relics of that flora having been
detected at Bovey Tracey." He believes, therefore,
that an Arctic flora took possession of England as
soon as the climate enabled it to live in the country.
Arctic plants, according to this explanation of the
sequence of events, were the first immigrants to
reconquer the dreary, plantless wastes and make
them habitable for mammals.</p>

<p>Fortunately these views do not at all agree with
those of many of our leading European botanists and
others entitled to have a voice in the matter. Professor
Warming is of opinion that the main mass of
the present flora of Greenland survived the Glacial
period in that country (p. 403); whilst Professor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Drude has shown (p. 288) that all plant life could
not possibly have been destroyed in northern
countries. He maintains that the greater part of
the Arctic floral elements which unite Greenland
and Scandinavia must have survived the Glacial
period in these countries in sheltered localities.
Indeed, he justly remarks, where at the present
moment do we find such plantless wastes? Greenland,
Franz-Josef Land, and Grinnell Land, situated
in high Arctic latitudes, all have a flora composed
of flowering plants and cryptograms. "I cannot
understand," he continues (p. 286), "why a flora,
possibly mixed with northern forms but in the main
points agreeing with our present floral elements,
should not have persisted throughout the Ice Age
even in the heart of Germany." "To my mind,"
says Col. Feilden, the well-known Arctic traveller
(<i>b</i>, p. 51), "it seems indisputable that several plants
now confined to the polar area must have originated
there, and have outlived the period of greatest ice-development
in that region." The theory in favour of
a survival of the pre-glacial flora has been especially
strengthened by the late Mr. Ball (than whom
probably no botanist possessed a better knowledge
of Alpine plants), who was strongly in favour
of this view as far as the Alps are concerned.
"Is it credible," he says (p. 576), "that in the
short interval since the close of the Glacial period
hundreds of very distinct species and several genera
have been developed on the Alps, and, what is no less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
hard to conceive, that several of these non-Arctic
species and genera should still more recently have
been distributed at wide intervals throughout a discontinuous
mountain chain some 1,500 miles in length,
from the Pyrenees to the Eastern Carpathians?" Mr.
Ball's remarks, indeed, just touch upon a very important
characteristic of all the so-called <i>Alpine plants</i>. In
Europe they chiefly occur in Scandinavia and the
central and southern mountain ranges, whilst they
are mostly absent from the intervening lowlands.
Again, we find a large number of species in the
mountains of Central Asia and in some of the North
American mountains. Almost all species of Alpine
plants, in fact, are examples of discontinuous distribution;
and this, as every naturalist knows, is always, in
both animals and plants, a proof of antiquity.</p>

<p>The glacial or Alpine flora is very old, and must
have originated long before the Ice Age. But it might
be urged, why should these plants be now almost confined
to the Arctic regions and the higher mountain
ranges, where the temperature undoubtedly is very
low, if they had originated during a pre-glacial
period probably much milder than the present?
The answer can be given by those who have made
Alpine plants their special study, and who have
attempted to grow them by administering to them
a temperature and such climatic conditions as to
be most conducive to good health. We should all
expect these plants to be very robust, and especially
to be able to stand extremely low temperatures. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
strange to say, the very opposite is the case. Professor
Blytt tells us (p. 19) that "Arctic and Alpine
species in the Christiania Botanic Gardens endure the
strongest summer heat without injury, while they are
often destroyed when not sufficiently covered during
winter." The English climate then, one would
think, ought to suit these plants, since the winters
are not too cold; but we find that at Kew Gardens
the large collection of Alpine plants have to be
wintered in frames under glass in order to keep
them in good health; and Professor Dyer, the
Director of the Gardens, thinks they are mostly
intolerant of very low temperatures (compare also
pp. <a href="#Page_161">161</a>-<a href="#Page_164">164</a>).</p>

<p>Such being the constitution of Alpine plants, how
could they possibly have originated during the Glacial
period and wandered from the mountains into the
plains, across numbers of formidable barriers, often
exposed to icy winds, for thousands of miles? As a
matter of fact, Alpine plants have survived in the
high North and in the Alps because they are there
permanently protected during winter by a covering of
snow from very low temperatures, and they are at the
same time prevented from drying up. If they are
given sufficient moisture and a constant, mild temperature
they seem to do very well. Such conditions are
afforded them in many parts of the British Islands, and
we find indeed the Mountain Avens (<i>Dryas octopetala</i>),
one of the most typically Arctic plants, growing wild
in profusion on the coast of Galway, in Ireland, at sea-level.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>The winter temperature of that part of Ireland
resembles that of southern Europe, being no less than
12° Fahr. above freezing point. This fact appears
to strengthen the view not only that the Alpine
flora is of pre-glacial origin, but that the climate of
Europe during the Glacial period was mild.</p>

<p>Having now shortly reviewed the state of our
knowledge with regard to the former presence in
our temperate latitudes of Arctic animals and plants,
it still remains for me to give a succinct statement of
the light thrown by this fauna and flora on the widespread
phenomena of glaciation. It is necessary to
do so, because, though the greater development of
glaciers on the mountains of Europe in former times
does not presuppose the prevalence of an Arctic
climate, the survival through the Ice Age of a fauna
and flora could not possibly have taken place in
northern Europe if the theories of glaciation now so
much in vogue are really true. Professor Geikie
reminds us, in speaking of his native country (p.
67), that "we must believe that all the hills
and valleys were once swathed in snow and
ice; that the whole of Scotland was at some
distant date buried underneath one immense <i>mer
de glace</i>, through which peered only the higher
mountain tops." That under such conditions no
fauna or flora to speak of could have survived in
Scotland is evident. Then again he argues (p. 426)
that because in the great plain of Europe we meet
occasionally with striated rock-surfaces and <i>roches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
moutonnées</i> very similar to those produced by the
glaciers of Switzerland, it must have been traversed
by "inland ice" flowing from Scandinavia and the
Baltic southward. The boulder clay of Germany is
supposed to have accumulated underneath this
vast "<i>mer de glace</i>," as he calls it. There is
no question here of a simple local development
of glaciers, such as could have existed under a
mild and moist climate; practically all the plants
and animals would have been annihilated in northern
Europe under such conditions, as there were no areas
free from ice. A more vivid idea of the state of
Europe during the epoch of maximum glaciation
will be obtained by looking at Professor Geikie's
map (p. 437). The whole of Scandinavia, Iceland,
Scotland, Ireland, and Switzerland is there represented
as having been completely enveloped in ice,
and also the greater part of Russia, Germany, and
England. In speaking of Scandinavia (p. 424) he
remarks that "the whole country has been moulded
and rubbed and polished by one immense sheet
of ice, which in its deeper portions could hardly
have been less than 5000 feet or even 6000
feet thick." The greater portion of the area indicated
as having been underneath a sheet of ice is
thickly covered with superficial accumulations of
gravel, sand, and clay. The latter is generally
spoken of as "boulder clay," and, with the associated
sand and gravel, it may be observed equally well in
Russia or Germany, in England or Ireland. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
rule these stony clays thicken out as they are traced
from the high-lying tracts to the low grounds; and
especially near the mountains the rock-surfaces are
often polished and striated. "For many years it was
believed," continues Professor Geikie (p. 432), "that
all those superficial deposits were of iceberg origin.
The low grounds of Northern Europe were supposed
to have been submerged at a time when numerous
icebergs, detached from glaciers in Scandinavia and
Finland, sailed across the drowned countries, dropping
rock-rubbish on the way. Such was thought to have
been the origin of the erratics, stony clay, and other
superficial accumulations, and hence they came to be
known as the 'great northern drift formation.'" "But,"
he adds (p. 433), "when the phenomena came to
be studied in greater detail and over a wider area,
this explanation did not prove satisfactory. The
facts described in the preceding paragraphs&mdash;the
occurrence of striated surfaces and <i>roches moutonnées</i>,
the disturbed appearances associated with
the till, and the not infrequent presence of giants'
kettles&mdash;convinced geologists that all the vast
regions over which boulder-clay is distributed were
formerly occupied by the 'inland ice' of Scandinavia."</p>

<p>I think Professor Geikie over-estimates the value of
the evidences which appear to be in favour of his
theory. His treatise on the Ice Age leaves one
under the impression that the older view of the
marine origin of the boulder-clay is not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
done with for good and all, but that no geologists
nowadays believe in it. If a more careful study of
the glacial phenomena has led most geologists to
abandon what I might call the "marine view" in
favour of the terrestrial one, a more careful study
of the fauna and flora will, I venture to think, have
the opposite effect. However, it appears that even
from a purely geological point of view more can
be said in favour of the old theory than Professor
Geikie and his school are ready to admit.
Thus we are told by Professor Bonney (p. 280),
in referring to the boulder-clay, that "the singular
mixture and apparent crossing of the paths of
boulders are less difficult to explain on the hypothesis
of distribution by floating ice than on that of
transport by land-ice, because, in the former case,
though the drift of winds and currents would be
generally in one direction, both might be varied at
particular seasons. So far as concerns the distribution
and thickness of the glacial deposits, there is not
much to choose between either hypothesis; but on
that of land-ice it is extremely difficult to explain
the intercalation of perfectly stratified sands and
gravel and of boulder-clay, as well as the not infrequent
signs of bedding in the latter." "Anything,"
writes Professor Cole (p. 239), "that keeps open the
position maintained by Lyell and others, that
extensive glaciation is compatible with mild and
sheltered nooks and corners, and that much of
the distribution of boulder-clay was performed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
seas and not on land, may be welcomed by
rationalists, at any rate until further research has
been carried on among the Arctic glaciers. At
present every year brings evidence of modern
marine boulder-clays in high latitudes, and removes
us farther and farther from belief in a <i>moraine
profonde</i>." That foraminifera are occasionally found
in boulder-clay has been known for a long time,
but it is only within recent years that these marine
organisms have been shown to occur in so many
localities, that Mr. Wright, who examined a large
number of samples, says (p. 269), "I am forced
to the conclusion that the Scottish as well as
the Irish boulder-clay is a true marine sedimentary
deposit."</p>

<p>In the fourth and fifth chapters I shall return to
this subject again, and mention a number of facts
of distribution which appear to me much easier of
explanation by means of the marine than by the land-ice
theory. But I do not propose to go into further
geological details in this volume, as I think I have
clearly conveyed my position in this controversy.</p>

<p>Before concluding this short review of the glacial
problem, so far as it affects the origin of the European
fauna, I should like to refer to the opinion of one
who has devoted years to the study of the glacial
phenomena in the Arctic Regions, viz., Col.
Feilden. "To a certain extent," he says (<i>a</i>, p. 57),
"all boulder clays at home are fragmentary when
compared with the boulder-bearing beds of Kolguev,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
which we may safely assume are 50 miles in length
by 40 in width, with a thickness of not less than 250
feet, probably far more, all lying in one undisturbed
mass. It is suggestive that all the glacial deposits
which I have met with in Arctic and Polar lands,
with the exception of the terminal moraines now
forming above sea-level in areas so widely separated
as Smith's Sound, Grinnell Land, North Greenland,
Spitsbergen, Novaya Zemlya, and Arctic Norway,
should be glacio-marine beds. Throughout this
broad expanse of the Arctic Regions I have come
across no beds that could be satisfactorily assigned
to the direct action of land-ice; that is to say, beds
formed <i>in situ</i> by the grinding force and pressure of
an ice-sheet. On the contrary, so far as I can judge,
the glacial beds which I have traced over the extensive
area mentioned above have all been deposited
subaqueously and re-elevated."</p>

<p>One of the strongest arguments that can be used
against the view of the marine origin of the glacial
phenomena in Northern Europe seems to me the fact
that we find polished rock-surfaces far removed from
the source of glaciers, and so exactly resembling those
produced at the present day by our Alpine glaciers as
to appear identical to the experienced eye. Most of
such striated and polished rocks occurring in the
higher mountain ranges of Scandinavia, and also of
the British Islands, have no doubt been actually produced
by glaciers, whilst those in the plain, sometimes
hundreds of miles away from the mountains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
must have originated in a similar manner; that is to
say, by a heavy mass of material containing stones
being slowly dragged over the rock-surfaces. The
weight which causes the stones to polish the latter is
generally ice, but it is quite conceivable that any other
substance, especially if it is in a semi-solid state, must
act and operate in much the same way. All polished
rock-surfaces are carved by glaciers, because we can
see them done by glaciers every day, is the argument
commonly used nowadays. It was not so formerly.
But Mr. Mallet and his views are almost forgotten
now; his name does not even appear in our great
modern works on the Ice Age. His argument was
that as the land rose out of the glacial sea, the mud
which had accumulated round the shore slipped
downward in a direction determined by the contour
of the surrounding valleys and mountains. The
moment the land rose above water-level, the large
mass of gravel and mud lying upon it slipped downward.
During a steady rising of the land there would
therefore be produced a continuous sliding down of
this mud-glacier, which would groove and polish the
rock underneath it, in the same manner as the ice-glaciers
do in the Alps (p. 47). Professors Sedgwick
and Haughton became strong adherents of Mr.
Mallet's theory at the time, but it seems later on
to have fallen into disfavour with geologists, who
may not even be thankful to have it brought to
light again.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p><h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER II.</h3>

<p>I have endeavoured to show in this chapter how we can determine
approximately the original home of an animal. By this
means we are able to study the component elements of the
European fauna, which is found to consist to a large extent of
migrants from the neighbouring continents. There is a Siberian,
an Oriental, and an Arctic element in it. The remainder of the
fauna is derived from local centres of dispersal. What was
formerly believed to have been one great northern migration
now resolves itself, on closer study, into two very distinct
ones&mdash;the Siberian and the Arctic. The mammals have
received most attention hitherto, because their remains are so
frequently met with, thus enabling us more easily to investigate
their past history; but butterflies and snails have not been
neglected, and at least one very remarkable work on the latter
has been published dealing with their origin in Europe and
in the remainder of the Palæarctic region.</p>

<p>The former distribution of land and water is intimately connected
with the origin of the European fauna, and the changes
which have taken place in this respect may be best traced by
the present distribution of mammals, snails, and earthworms.
In this manner the British Islands may be shown to have been
connected with one another and with the Continent; Spain
with Morocco across the Straits of Gibraltar; Greece with Asia
Minor, and so forth.</p>

<p>The British fauna has played such an important part in the
evolution of the European fauna, that it forms the key to the
solution of the wider problem. In it five elements are
recognisable, of which the Lusitanian element is the oldest,
and the Siberian the most recent. It has been deemed
advisable to conclude this chapter with a short review of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
history of the Glacial period in its climatic effects on the
animals and plants of Europe. A number of writers are
quoted who have conducted special researches in determining
the temperature of our continent at the time. The fauna of
Europe is frequently described as having been of an Arctic
nature, but as a matter of fact there existed during the Ice
Age a striking and most remarkable mingling of a northern
and a southern fauna. The presence of Siberian mammals in
Europe is said to have been due to the prevalence of a dry
steppe climate, but this view is not supported by other evidence.
The Alpine flora in a wide sense is probably pre-glacial in
origin, and appears to have survived the Ice Age where it
is now known to exist. A few words on the phenomena of
glaciation are added before bringing the chapter to a close.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III.<br />

THE FAUNA OF BRITAIN.</h2>


<p>The British Islands are, as I have remarked, very
suitable as a starting-point for our investigations.
Their fauna and flora are fairly well known, and the
distribution of the large animals at any rate, which
are of course of much importance in these researches,
has been as much studied as that of any other area
in Europe. We possess in England an abundance of
the remains of past animal life, and a combination of
the data furnished by both of these important factors
will enable us to draw up a history of the origin of
the present British fauna.</p>

<p>In the first chapter I indicated that in the fauna of
the British Islands three divisions or elements are
recognisable&mdash;a northern, a southern, and an eastern.
These elements correspond to migrations which can
be proved to have arrived in this country at different
periods in past times. When we investigate these
migrations more closely, the eastern is found to be
composed partly of European and partly of Siberian
species. The southern is made up of European
and of Central and Southern Asiatic species. To
make matters still more complex, the southern and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
eastern migrations insensibly merge into one another,
so that it is often very difficult to determine to which
of them an animal may belong. The European
species spread principally from three centres over
Europe&mdash;viz., from the Lusitanian, Alpine, and the
Balkan centres. The southern element of the British
fauna is therefore composed of animals which have
originated in these three centres, and in Central and
Southern Asia. The Balkan species have been
included with those coming from the latter centre
under the term "Oriental" migration. The sixth
chapter is devoted to it, whilst the Lusitanian and
Alpine migrations have each a chapter to themselves.</p>

<p>The Arctic Hare is, as I have already mentioned,
one of the mammals of the northern element of the
British fauna. It is now confined to the mountains of
Scotland and the plain and mountains of Ireland.
But in former times it had a wider range in the
British Islands. The Stoat is another distinctly
northern mammal. It occurs with us, as Messrs.
Thomas and Barrett-Hamilton have pointed out,
in two distinct varieties or species, the one being
confined to Great Britain, the other to Ireland. As
I shall explain more fully later on (p. <a href="#Page_135">135</a>), I have
reasons to believe that the Irish Stoat came from the
Arctic Regions as a northern migrant, but that the
English Stoat, on the other hand, reached England
with the Siberian fauna from the east. A third
northern animal, now extinct in the British Islands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
is the Reindeer. It is supposed to have died out in
these countries not very many centuries ago, and
records have been handed down to us that it still
inhabited Scotland as late as the thirteenth century.
Like the Stoat, it occurred in two well-known varieties,
distinguished from one another by the shape
and form of the antlers. In the English pleistocene
deposits the remains of both kinds are met with
mingled together, whilst in Ireland only one of them
has been found. The explanation of this case is
similar to that of the two stoats. One of the varieties,
which we may call the northern one, came to us from
the Arctic Regions; the second wandered to the
British Islands at a later period, when Ireland had
probably become separated from England. It was
therefore unable to penetrate so far west.</p>

<p>One of the most familiar examples of a northern
British bird is the Red Grouse (<i>Lagopus scoticus</i>). By
most authorities it is looked upon as a species distinct
from the Scandinavian Willow Grouse (<i>Lagopus
albus</i>), but except in colour it is indistinguishable
from it, and the eggs are identical. The whole genus
<i>Lagopus</i> is a distinctly Arctic one, and there can be
no doubt that the British Grouse belongs to the
northern migration, just like the Arctic Hare. The
Ptarmigan (<i>Lagopus mutus</i>) and the Snow Bunting
are also migrants from the north. Though as resident
British birds they are quite confined to Scotland, the
remains of the former have been found in a cave in
the south of Ireland, showing that its range in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
British Islands was formerly more extensive. Another
bird which probably came to our shores with this
same migration, though it is now unfortunately extinct,
is the Great Auk (<i>Alca impennis</i>), of which
some specimens have luckily been preserved in our
museums. From the occurrence of its remains in
kitchen-middens and other recent deposits, the Great
Auk is known to have inhabited the coasts of Scotland,
Ireland, and Scandinavia, as well as those of Newfoundland.
Mr. Ussher recently found the bones of
this bird near Waterford, which, I believe, is the most
southern locality known. The manner of their occurrence
leaves no doubt that the bird had been used as
food by the early races of man. In all probability it
originated in the Arctic Regions, and subsequently
spread south on either side of the Atlantic. We
need not here refer to the many winter visitants,&mdash;northern
birds which appear regularly, or at more
or less long intervals, in these islands,&mdash;although in
most of the ornithological works they are included
under the term "British Birds."</p>

<p>All the British reptiles and amphibia appear to
have reached us from the south or east, but among
the fishes there are a good many northern forms.
The whole salmon family&mdash;the <i>Salmonidæ</i>&mdash;are
typical northern immigrants. The Stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus
aculeatus</i>), too, has undoubtedly come to us
from the north. The genus <i>Cottus</i>, like <i>Gasterosteus</i>,
is certainly Arctic in origin. Originally freshwater
forms, many species are now found between tide-marks,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>and of these a few have migrated southward
along the coasts of the great continents. Thus we
meet with various species of <i>Cottus</i> as far south as
California and Japan, on the American and Asiatic
coasts of the Pacific respectively. In Europe, two
species, viz., <i>C. scorpio</i> and <i>C. bubalis</i>, range as far
south as the French coast. Our freshwater <i>Cottus</i>,
the Miller's thumb (<i>Cottus gobio</i>), has migrated to
us from the north with the Arctic species. All the
freshwater forms, indeed, of this genus are typically
Arctic.</p>

<p>A large number of land and freshwater invertebrates
too have no doubt reached us from the north. Some
of them may have originated in Scandinavia or within
the Arctic Circle, but others probably came still
farther, either from America or even from Asia, and
used the Arctic land-connection <i>viâ</i> Greenland in their
migration to Europe. As I shall give a number of
additional instances of such migrants in the succeeding
chapters, I need not, perhaps, dwell upon them
now any longer, except to mention a few of the
more typical ones. <i>Vertigo alpestris</i>, a minute snail
with an amber-coloured shell, and our freshwater
pearl-mussel, <i>Unio (Margaritana) margaritifer</i>, belong
to this migration. Then among butterflies we may
cite the Marsh-ringlet (<i>Coenonympha typhon</i>), and
among beetles, <i>Pelophila borealis</i> and <i>Blethisa multipunctata</i>.
There are a number of northern spiders,
among which a few certainly indicate an Arctic
origin, or at any rate, that they have wandered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Europe across Greenland and the old Arctic land-connections.
<i>Bathyphantes nigrinus</i>, <i>Linyphia insignis</i>,
and <i>Drapetisca socialis</i>, for instance, are three British
species whose range indicates a northern origin, and
which also occur, according to Mr. Carpenter, in
North America. Mr. Carpenter also tells me that the
Collembolan, <i>Isotoma littoralis</i>, is a typical northern
migrant. He has recently discovered it in the west
of Ireland, its only station in the British Islands.</p>

<p>Among the crustacea, the genus <i>Apus</i> forms an
exceedingly interesting illustration of the northern
migration, <i>Apus glacialis</i> having been discovered in
a Scottish pleistocene freshwater deposit, whilst it is
now almost confined to the Arctic regions.</p>

<p>To the same group of animals also belong the three
remarkable species of freshwater sponges, <i>Ephydatia
crateriformis</i>, <i>Heteromeyenia Ryderi</i>, and <i>Tubella pensylvanica</i>,
which Dr. Hanitsch has described from some
lakes in Western Ireland. None of these are known
from Great Britain or from the continent of Europe.
A few North American plants grow wild in the same
district. That any of these should owe their existence
in Ireland to accidental introduction appears to me
exceedingly improbable. In a former contribution
to this subject (<i>a</i>, p. 475) I assumed that
these American plants and animals had migrated
to Europe at the same time as the other northern
forms referred to. My friend Mr. Carpenter, however,
takes exception to this (p. 383), and I quite
recognise the force of his argument. "Their very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
restricted and discontinuous ranges," he says, "along
the extreme western margin of Europe mark them
as decidedly older than those northern animals and
plants which have a circumpolar distribution." We
have indeed quite similar examples in the Oriental
migration, of which part is very ancient, surviving
here and there and exhibiting discontinuous distribution.
We may therefore look upon these American
immigrants as among the oldest members of that
northern stock which have survived in our islands&mdash;probably
a mere remnant of a once luxuriant flora
and fauna.</p>

<p>In order to show the importance of the Eastern or
Siberian element in the English, or, we might say
with Dr. Sclater, the Anglo-Scotian mammalian
fauna, I herewith give a list of the species of
mammals which probably migrated to Great Britain
from Siberia. I have marked with an asterisk those
which still exist in this country (not in Ireland), or
have become extinct within historic times.</p>

<p>We have evidence that most of these twenty-six
species of mammals came from Eastern Europe, but
there is no reason to suppose that they originated there.
On the contrary, it is highly probable, as I said before,
that their native home is Siberia, and that they
entered Europe to the north of the Caspian. Along
with these, vast numbers of other forms of life, and
also plants, swarmed into our continent, and as we
advance eastward from England we meet with them
in increasing numbers to the present day. But not
only on the Continent do we find these survivals of
the great Siberian migration, which has been so ably
described by Professor Nehring; no less than nine
species still inhabit Great Britain (if we include the
recently extinct Beaver). On the other hand, not
more than three have been found fossil in Ireland,
and of these only one still survives. This very significant
fact will be referred to again more fully on p. <a href="#Page_153">153</a>.
Meanwhile it should be remembered that these
three species, viz., <i>Mustela erminea</i>, <i>Equus caballus</i>,
and <i>Rangifer tarandus</i>, occur in Ireland in varieties
distinct from those found in Central Europe. It is
upon this, and many other circumstances, that
I founded my belief that Ireland was already
separated from England at the time of the arrival
of the Siberian emigrants in the latter country. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
we shall see, the Irish Stoat, Horse, and Reindeer
probably came by a different route from that taken
by the English representatives of the same species.</p>

<p>Very few of the lower animals of Siberian origin
have reached the British Islands. Most of those
which were formerly thought to be Siberian are either
of East European or of Central and South Asiatic
origin, though they probably joined the Siberian
migration on their way to England. The Arctic
migration brought a greater variety of species to
this country than the Siberian, but neither the one
nor the other has contributed more than a small percentage
to the British fauna. The bulk of that fauna
is derived from the various European centres of dispersal,
and especially from Central and Southern Asia.</p>

<p>Those animals which have their home in the latter
area, I have named Orientals, though it must be remembered
that they need not necessarily have come
from what is known among zoologists as the "Oriental
Region." The terms "Oriental animals" and "Oriental
migration" are used here in a wider sense, and
include even those species which reached Central and
Northern Europe from South-Eastern Europe. It is
astonishing, what a vast number of both vertebrate
and invertebrate animals can be traced back to this
Oriental migration. Great tracts of Europe were
repeatedly submerged beneath the sea during Tertiary
times, and on their re-appearance were formed into
green fields and pastures new for the rich Asiatic
fauna, which was ever ready to flood the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
continent. This went on, and not for a comparatively
short space of time, as in the case of the Siberian
invasion; the immeasurable ages which passed,
whilst several of the Tertiary epochs dawned upon
Europe, witnessed an almost constant stream of
Asiatic immigrants pouring in upon us. Europe
returned her own products in exchange, but they
must have been scanty in comparison to the enormous
number of species which have undoubtedly
originated in Central and Southern Asia. Very
many of the widely distributed forms in the British
Islands are of Oriental origin. Among these are
also the cosmopolitan species, such as the Barn
Owl (<i>Strix flammea</i>) and the Painted Lady Butterfly
(<i>Vanessa cardui</i>). A great number of our
British Mammals, Birds, Butterflies, and Beetles have
come to us with the Oriental migration. But, as
I shall explain in the special chapter devoted to it,
the earlier migrants from the south-east found their
northward progress barred by a great sea which
stretched through Central Europe from west to east.
The Mediterranean was then divided into two smaller
basins. On their arrival in Greece, which was then
connected with Asia Minor and Southern Italy,
the Oriental migrants seem to have turned westward,
skirting the shores of the Mediterranean. When they
finally reached Spain, many then changed their course
northward (see <a href="#Figure05">Fig. 5</a>, p. <a href="#Page_117">117</a>) and wandered to the
British Islands with the Lusitanian animals which
came from South-Western Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p><p>Dr. Wallace makes mention of a fairly large number
of species and varieties of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera,
and land and freshwater Mollusca, supposed to be
<i>peculiar to the British Islands</i>. Even if these were all
found to be of British origin, most of their nearest
relatives are continental species. Many, however, must
be looked upon as mere races or sub-species of
familiar continental forms. But others, such as <i>Geomalacus
maculosus</i> and <i>Asiminea Grayana</i>, are by no
means confined to the British Islands. Some of
the so-called varieties enumerated by Dr. Wallace
are merely slight individual variations in form and
colour, which, only by the extraordinary tendency of
the variety-monger to advertise himself, have received
a distinct Latin denomination. The number of the
remaining species, after weeding out the unworthy
ones, will be found to be insignificant.</p>

<p>Similarly, the list of seventy-five species and
varieties of flowering plants included by Dr. Wallace
among the forms peculiar to the British Islands
(p. 360) is reduced by Sir Joseph Hooker to twenty.
The remainder are to be considered as varietal forms
of a very trifling departure from the type, or as
hybrids.</p>

<p>Just as we distinguish in the British Islands the
parts inhabited by Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Irishmen,
so we can recognise three divisions in the animal
world, and these roughly correspond to the boundaries
of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Most of the
eastern species inhabit England, most of the northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
ones are confined to Scotland, whilst Ireland is occupied
chiefly by southern animals. This, however, is
only a very rough-and-ready method of sub-dividing
the British Islands into their component parts
according to the origin of their faunas. On closer
study such a division is found to be unsatisfactory.
The eastern species do not really stop at the Scottish
frontier, they range far into Scotland. Nor are the
northern forms confined to the latter country. Many
of them range into Ireland, and also into England. I
have constructed a map of the British Islands showing
approximately the boundaries of the northern, eastern,
and southern species (p. <a href="#Page_7">7</a>), but even this may not
altogether meet with the views of an ornithologist
or conchologist. For every group of animals the
boundaries would probably require to be marked
differently. There is also a good deal of overlapping,
so that the attempt to define the limits of the various
elements meets with great difficulties. But the map
represents, I think, fairly well the general impression
one receives as to the disposition of its component
elements, after a careful study of the British fauna
as a whole.</p>

<p>The distribution of the British plants has been
worked out much more thoroughly than that of the
animals. It need not surprise us, therefore, that the
first attempt to separate the British Islands into
natural divisions was made by a botanist&mdash;the late
Mr. Watson. As he himself pointed out, in making
these divisions he did not take into consideration the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
origin of the British species. They represent merely
groups of assemblages of plants of different types
of vegetation. Edward Forbes, on the other hand,
founded his districts on the origin of plants. His
work is not only the first of the kind, but it is a
classical essay, and remains one of the most remarkable
contributions to the literature on the geographical
distribution of living organisms known to science.
The vegetation of the British Islands, he informs us
(p. 4), presents a union of five well-marked floras,
four of which are restricted to definite provinces,
whilst the fifth, besides exclusively claiming a great
part of the area, overspreads and commingles with
all the others. These are&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">

</table></div>

<p>Professor Forbes points out, in connection with the
plants of the Germanic type, that the fauna accompanying
this flora presents the same peculiarities and
diminishes westward and to the north. This type
includes, therefore, almost all the species which can
be shown to have come to us directly from the east,
few if any of which have penetrated to Ireland.</p>

<p>On a previous occasion, the same author had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
divided the British Islands into ten districts, according
to the distribution of their molluscan fauna.
These are&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left:20%;">
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman;">
<li>The Channel Isles.</li>
<li>South-east of England (including Cambridgeshire).</li>
<li>South-west of England.</li>
<li>North-east of England.</li>
<li>North-west of England (including Isle of Man).</li>
<li>North of Ireland.</li>
<li>South of Ireland.</li>
<li>South of Scotland.</li>
<li>North of Scotland.</li>
<li>Shetland Isles.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>In a short paper on this subject (<i>b</i>, p. 5), I have
shown that some of these districts are founded on
erroneous data, whilst, with the knowledge now at
our disposal, others can no longer be maintained as
distinct. I thought then that the molluscan fauna
warranted a division of the British Islands into the
following two provinces:&mdash;</p>

<div style="margin-left:20%;">
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-roman;">
<li>England and Wales (except the South-west).</li>
<li>South-west of England and Wales and the whole of Ireland and
Scotland.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>The second district contains some species of molluscs
which are almost entirely absent from the first,
such as <i>Geomalacus maculosus</i>, <i>Testacella Maugei</i>,
<i>Helix pisana</i>, <i>Helix revelata</i>, <i>Helix acuta</i>, and <i>Pupa
ringens</i>. These are all of Lusitanian origin, and do
not occur in Central Europe. Scotland alone cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
be classed as a separate province, since it does not
contain a single species peculiar to itself. But, along
with Ireland and the South-west of England and
Wales, it is distinguished from the remainder of
these countries by the almost total absence of what
have been called Germanic types.</p>

<p>A French conchologist, the late Dr. Fischer, dealt
with the British molluscan fauna in a somewhat
similar spirit (p. 57). He divided the British area
into two districts, but these differ from mine in so
far as the South-west of England and Wales and the
West of Ireland form one; the remainder of England
and Ireland as well as the whole of Scotland the
other. His classification is of particular interest,
since the first district represents part of a larger
Atlantic province, the second a portion of the Germanic
province of the European sub-region. The
latter he looks upon as one of the sub-regions of
the great Palæarctic Region. Attention is thus
drawn to the intimate relationship existing between
the western parts of the British Islands and the
Spanish peninsula on the one hand, and between the
eastern portions and Central Europe on the other.</p>

<p>Mr. Jordan's North-Sea-and-Baltic district includes
Scotland and the North of Ireland, whilst England
joined with the West and South of Ireland forms part
of his Celtic province. Both of these districts or provinces
belong to Mr. Jordan's greater Germanic
Region (p. 302).</p>

<p>In the collection illustrating the geographical distribution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>of animals in the Dublin Museum, the
British species have been grouped into three divisions.
One contains those with a wide range over the British
Islands, another the characteristic forms of the south-east
and lowland districts of Great Britain, and the
third the Irish and the western and highland Anglo-Scotian
species. Mr. Carpenter has named the last
two divisions the "<i>Teutonic</i>" and the "<i>Celtic</i>." More
recently, he has recognised that this last division
contains two distinct groups; one including animals
of northern, the other those of southern origin.
He acknowledges indeed, just as I do, three distinct
faunas in the British Islands, with the addition of
the group of generally distributed species of undetermined
origin.</p>

<p>Many other naturalists have worked in the direction
I have indicated&mdash;namely, in grouping the
British animals into several distinct assemblages,
without, however, taking their foreign range into
consideration, or their origin. I have already referred
to the useful work done by botanists, who have been
the pioneers in the science of the geographical distribution
of living organisms. Among the British
naturalists who have applied the principles of Watson
to zoology, A. G. More deserves to be specially mentioned.
He was the first to make a serious study of
the British fauna on the lines laid down by that distinguished
botanist. In conjunction with E. Boyd,
he published a valuable essay on the "Distribution of
Butterflies in Great Britain," and later on the birds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
were similarly dealt with. All the more important
groups of animals are now being studied with a view
to determining their exact range in these islands.
Mr. Harvie-Brown, Mr. J. W. Taylor, Mr. Eagle Clarke,
Mr. Miller Christy, Mr. Ussher, Mr. Barrington, and
a number of others have considerably advanced our
knowledge in this direction in recent years.</p>

<p>Any such contributions are to be welcomed as
furnishing us with the necessary data to solve the
problem of the origin of the British fauna. Meanwhile
we know enough to enable us to assert
positively that the latter has reached us by land-connections
from various parts of Europe (cf. p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a>).
This statement of course refers to the bulk of the
British fauna. The small proportion of indigenous
species, or such as have been introduced accidentally,
may be left out of consideration when dealing with
the great mass of animals which have evidently
migrated to the British Islands on land now sunk
beneath the sea (see <a href="#Figure04">Fig. 4</a>, p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>). Opinions of
zoologists, botanists, and geologists are practically
unanimous on this subject; yet there are two other
theories, which have from time to time been advanced
to account for the origin of the British fauna. Only
the first of these, however, can claim the serious
attention of those interested in the problem. Its
chief contention lies in the oft-asserted dictum of
the "<i>imperfection of geological record</i>." It has been
suggested, in fact, that the British fauna, instead
of having migrated to our islands, might have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
originated there, but that, owing to the fragmentary
nature of our Tertiary deposits, all trace of their
early history had disappeared. "The origin of
European species," remarks Professor Cole (p. 238),
"within the area of the British Isles, and their
migration outwards when local conditions became
less favourable for their multiplication, are possibilities
that seem too often disregarded. Yet
the geologist must see in the western borderland
of modern Europe a diminished continent from
which land-animals must have again and again
moved eastward." "Hence geologists may fairly be
unwilling to look on our isles as barren lands waiting
to be peopled in pliocene or later times. Far rather
has the breaking up of a broad land-area along the
present continental edge sent our land-fauna to the
new steppes that opened eastward, leaving us a
mere diminished remnant to struggle with the glacial
period."</p>

<p>There are in Professor Cole's views many points
with which I readily agree. In the first place, he
acknowledges that migration has taken place on
land, so that we have our land-connection between
Great Britain and the Continent whatever theory we
accept as to the direction taken by the migrants.
That the western borderland of Europe has given
rise to many important assemblages of animals in
past times, seems to me also exceedingly probable,
nor do I look upon the British Islands as "barren
lands waiting to be peopled in pliocene or later<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
times." On the contrary, I believe an almost uninterrupted
stream of migrants poured into the
British Isles before pliocene times from the south.
But what I thoroughly disagree with, is the remark
that our British land-fauna has been sent to the new
steppes that opened eastward. These are the more
or less arid portions of Eastern Europe. Professor
Cole no doubt has in mind those species of mammals
which I have included in what I called the Siberian
migration, and of which we have fossil evidence
in the late Tertiary deposits of Europe. It would
be impossible here to discuss this subject fully,
especially as I have done so in the subsequent
chapters; but, even if we had no geological record
whatsoever, the present range of the species in
question and their nearest relatives must convince
us that they could not have originated in Western
Europe. However, on the strength of the geological
evidence, Professor Nehring&mdash;the only one who has
made this fauna his special study&mdash;remarks (p. 228),
that there seems scarcely any doubt that this steppe-fauna
just referred to had come to us from the east.
Professors Boyd Dawkins, Brandt, and Lartet held
similar views.</p>

<p>The theory that an ice-sheet stretched across a
narrow sea might be the means of aiding a fauna
across from the mainland to an island, is particularly
inapplicable to the British Islands. Neither Mr.
Kinahan nor Mr. Lamplugh, the two supporters of
this view, have, however, taken the trouble to apply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
it to more than one species of the British fauna. An
ice-bridge, thinks Mr. Kinahan, "could easily have
connected Scotland and Ireland, thus giving a land
causeway for migration" (p. 3). Mr. Lamplugh
throws more light on this interesting speculation by
giving us the name of an animal which he believes
crossed a narrow sea on a bridge of ice. This animal
unfortunately happens to be one whose remains have
never been found in high northern latitudes, viz., the
Irish elk (<i>Cervus giganteus</i>). And because he is of
opinion that this species of extinct deer found its
way to the Isle of Man from the mainland on a
waning ice-sheet, he sees no reason why certain
elements of the Irish fauna should not have been
similarly introduced.</p>

<p>It seems of no advantage to begin the discussion
on the origin of the British fauna by assuming the
former existence of ice-bridges, and the possibility of
a migration across them of some of its members. If
a glacier connected Scotland and Ireland, the climate
of both countries (since they were highlands and
acted as the feeders of the ice-sheet) must have
been uncomfortable to the majority of the British
species. What were the inducements that could
have prompted those which had braved the discomforts
of Scotland to emigrate to Ireland at
such a time? What light does it throw on the
origin of the Irish fauna as a whole, to advance the
extremely improbable hypothesis that certain elements
of it may have reached Ireland by an ice-bridge?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>If any species came to that country in such
an unusual manner, surely they must have been Arctic
or northern forms. But what about the southern
species, which form the bulk of the Irish fauna and
also the flora? Even the Arctic element of the
British fauna, which probably includes, besides the
Reindeer, many hundreds of species, could not, I think,
have migrated to these islands on an ice-bridge. Indeed,
I agree with most of the writers who have dealt
with the subject, in asserting that the northern as well
as all the other elements of our fauna utilised for their
migration the old land-bridges which connected these
islands with one another and with the Continent.</p>

<p>There is a greater diversity of opinion as to the age
during which the British fauna arrived in these islands.
This is naturally a much more complicated problem,
but it is one which I am convinced will ultimately be
solved mainly by means of a study of the geographical
distribution of animals and plants. If we can settle
the relative ages of the various migrations, we thereby
supply an important link in our attempt to reconstruct
the past geographical features of the British Islands.
The range of the British species will give us an
idea of the nature of the land-connections and their
gradual changes in course of time. Geological data
are exceedingly valuable in these inquiries, but it is
a fatal mistake to build our geographical theories
and the origin of the British fauna as a whole
entirely on the assumptions of a certain school of
geologists. Unfortunately, Dr. White's very interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>remarks on the British fauna for this reason lose
much of the value which they might otherwise
possess.</p>

<p>In his remarkable essay the late Edward Forbes
affirms that the flora peculiar to the west of
Ireland, of which the strawberry tree (<i>Arbutus unedo</i>)
is the most striking example, and which exhibits such
strong southern affinities, is not only much the most
ancient of our island floras, but that it is actually of
miocene age. It migrated to Ireland from Spain at
a very remote period, during which he supposed that
a direct land-connection existed between the two
countries. The destruction of this old land-bridge,
he thinks, must have taken place before the commencement
of the Glacial period. Climatal changes
during that time destroyed the mass of the southern
flora which had thus reached Ireland, the survivors
being species such as were most hardy (saxifrages,
heaths, etc.), which he considers to be the only relics
of this most ancient portion of our flora.</p>

<p>The northern or Arctic fauna and flora, according
to the same author, established themselves in the
British Isles during the Glacial period&mdash;at a time
when these were groups of islands in the midst of
an ice-bound sea. Finally, the great mass of our
animals and plants migrated from the Continent to
England after the Glacial period. "The migration of
the species," he says, "less speedy of diffusion, which
are now peculiar to England was arrested by the
breaking up of the land-connection between England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
and Ireland, and thence the famous deficiencies of
the sister isle, as, for instance, its freedom from
reptiles" (p. 10). He is also of opinion, that the
separation between England and the Continent took
place at a later date than that between England
and Ireland.</p>

<p>According to Dr. A. R. Wallace (p. 338), we possessed
just before and during the Glacial period "a fauna
almost or quite identical with that of adjacent parts
of the Continent, and equally rich in species." But
the submersion, he thinks, which is supposed to have
occurred during the latter part of the Glacial period,
destroyed the greater part of the life of our country.
When England again became continental, continues
Dr. Wallace, this fauna was succeeded by an assemblage
of animals from Central Europe. "But sufficient
time does not seem to have elapsed for the migration
to have been completed before subsidence again
occurred, cutting off the further influx of purely
terrestrial animals, and leaving us without the number
of species which our favourable climate and varied
surface entitle us to." The comparative zoological
poverty of Ireland he attributes to the fact that "the
depth of the Irish Sea being somewhat greater than
that of the German Ocean, the connecting land
would there probably be of small extent and of less
duration, thus offering an additional barrier to
migration."</p>

<p>Dr. Wallace's explanation of the origin of the
British fauna is disappointing after Forbes's careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
study and critical inquiry into its component elements.
So great an authority on geographical
distribution might have given us more lucid statements
of his views on a variety of topics connected
with this subject.</p>

<p>In speaking of the fauna of Ireland, Professor
Leith Adams, Professor Dawkins, and Mr. Alston are
evidently only thinking of the mammals, which form
but a very small proportion of it. The first-mentioned
palæontologist held that there was a land-communication
between Scotland and Ireland at the
close of the Glacial period, by which the greater
portion of the mammals that had found their way to
the former country crossed to the latter (p. 100).
And, he continues, the severance between the two
countries must have taken place before the slow-travelling
Mole, the Beaver, the forest-haunting Elk
and the Roebuck had time to arrive.</p>

<p>Much in the same spirit are Mr. Alston's remarks
on this subject (p. 5). "The absence from the known
fossil fauna of Scotland and Ireland of most of the
characteristic post-pliocene English animals, shows
that the northward migration of these forms was slow,
gradually advancing as the glacial conditions of
the northern parts of our islands decreased in intensity.
Thus it is not difficult to suppose that the
Hedgehog, Ermine, Badger, Squirrel, and Mountain
Hare may have found their way through southern
Scotland into Ireland long before they were able to
penetrate into the still sub-arctic regions of the Highlands.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>Subsequently, when the improvement of the
climate had continued, the Shrews and Voles may
well have found their way northward along the comparatively
genial coasts, before the larger beasts of
prey could find a sufficient stock of game."</p>

<p>That the Bear, Wolf, Stag, Horse, Mammoth, and
Reindeer lived in Ireland before the Glacial period
is considered highly probable by Professor Boyd
Dawkins (<i>a</i>, p. 152).</p>

<p>Only the Butterflies are dealt with in Dr. Buchanan
White's clever little essay on distribution. And,
as I remarked before, his conclusions are somewhat
marred by the unwarrantable assumption that
our islands at no distant date were totally destitute
of all plant-life, and were therefore uninhabitable by
animals. But his paper differs in so far from most of
the others, that he has made a thorough study of the
one group he deals with. In some respects it may serve
as a model to future students in its general treatment
of the problem he has set himself to work out. He
adopts the principle, even for butterflies, that though
it is possible for them to be blown over from the
Continent, they have probably migrated with the rest
of our indigenous fauna and flora across the dry bed
of the German Ocean. His conclusions are that
Britain derived its butterfly fauna from continental
Europe in post-glacial times, that the Arctic and
Alpine species were the first arrivals, and that one
part of the Irish species reached Ireland by way of
Scotland, another from the south. He assumes, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
course, that Great Britain and Ireland were connected
at that time.</p>

<p>Within the last few years the spell which has bound
naturalists to accept the theory of a total destruction
of life during the Glacial period is happily vanishing,
and more enlightened views are gaining ground.
The Lusitanian species of plants in the west of Ireland,
which had already furnished Forbes with an
argument in favour of survival, are also regarded by
Mr. Bulman as the remnants of a pre-glacial flora
which was exterminated everywhere else by the
cold (p. 265). This view of the survival of a pre-glacial
fauna and flora has since been accepted by
Mr. Carpenter, whilst I also have endeavoured to
bring fresh evidence into the field in its favour.
We both agree with Edward Forbes in considering
the Lusitanian element as the oldest section of our
fauna and flora, and that it came long before the
Glacial period. But we differ somewhat from him,
in so far as we do not limit that element to Ireland.
It seems also to be represented in South-western
England and Wales, though it is there less conspicuous.</p>

<p>This decision as to the relative age of the British
South-western fauna has not been arrived at from any
geological considerations. The conviction that it
must be older than the other sections has been gained
solely from a study of the geographical distribution
of the species belonging to that fauna. Many of
them exhibit what is known as "discontinuous distribution,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>which zoologists are agreed to regard as a
sign of antiquity. Thus <i>Geomalacus maculosus</i>, the
Kerry Slug, is in the British Islands confined to South-western
Ireland (see <a href="#Figure19">Fig. 19</a>, p. <a href="#Page_300">300</a>), and on the Continent
it is unknown north of North-western Spain.
The Millipede, <i>Polydesmus gallicus</i>, has a wider range
in Ireland, and is also known from France and the
Azores. Two Earthworms of the Spanish and
Mediterranean region, viz., <i>Allolobophora veneta</i> and
<i>Georgii</i>, have been discovered in Ireland, but are
apparently unknown in England or France; whilst
the Weevil, <i>Otiorrhynchus auropunctatus</i>, does not
occur north of the Auvergne Mountains in France
except in Ireland. A very large number of instances
might be mentioned of species found in South-western
Europe, France, the South-west of England
and Ireland. Enough, however, has been said to
show the nature of the fauna, and there is, as
Forbes has pointed out, a corresponding flora.</p>

<p>A great number of the species belonging to the
South-western British element seem to have originated
in South-western Europe, or at any rate to have
spread over our continent from that part. Their
home lay therefore probably in a warm, damp
climate, and it seems a reasonable inference to
suppose that they spread north at a time when
the temperature over the British Islands was much
higher than what it is now. Any one familiar with
our Bristle fern, or Killarney fern, as it is called in
Ireland (<i>Trichomanes radicans</i>), will readily admit that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
it must have come to us at such an epoch. It at once
suggests some shady waterfall in a tropical forest, and
indeed the home of the genus is South America. It
is one of those plants which have evidently migrated
to us from South-western Europe, a mere remnant
of a once luxuriant flora.</p>

<p>Sir Archibald Geikie tells us (p. 837), and in the
main every one agrees with him, that at the beginning
of the Tertiary era in which we now live, the climate
was of a tropical and subtropical character in Europe.
Gradually it became more temperate, and eventually
it passed into a phase of extreme cold, but since that
time the cold has again gradually diminished. It is
quite evident, therefore, that from a purely geological
point of view our south-western flora must have
migrated northward before the cold came on, and
survived in sheltered localities under the influence
of the mild coast climate. Some, however, suppose
that there occurred a phase of extreme mildness immediately
after the Glacial period, and that it was
during that time that the Lusitanian fauna and flora
became established in the British Islands. To this
Professor James Geikie replies (<i>b</i>, p. 169), "there are few
points we can be more sure of than this, that since
the close of the Glacial epoch&mdash;since the deposition of
the clays with Arctic shells and the Saxicava sands&mdash;there
have been no great oscillations, but only a
gradual amelioration of climate. It is quite impossible
to believe that any warm period could have intervened
between the last Arctic and the present temperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
conditions without leaving some notable evidence in
the superficial deposits of Scotland, Scandinavia, and
North America." Thus it appears that on the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the assumption that the Lusitanian fauna and flora
are very ancient and pre-glacial is also supported
on geological evidence.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span>&mdash;Map of Europe, with arrows indicating approximately the course taken by the
different streams of migration towards the British Islands.</p>

<p>The course of events in the origin of the British
fauna might have been therefore somewhat as
follows:&mdash;In early Tertiary times, when the climate
all over Western Europe was moist and semi-tropical,
a migration proceeded northward from the south-western
corner of Europe. This was strengthened
by Oriental migrants which had moved westward
along the Mediterranean basin (<a href="#Figure05">Fig. 5</a>, No. 1).
Owing to geographical changes supervening, the
Alpine fauna (No. 2) was then enabled to colonise
the British Islands, and subsequently another migration
had begun to come in from the south-east
(No. 3). The climate had meanwhile gradually
become more temperate and drier. About the same
time, or even earlier, an Arctic migration commenced
to pass southward (No. 4), and finally the Siberian
animals (No. 5) poured into our continent. The
arrows in the map indicate the directions followed by
the different migrants as they travelled to the British
Islands. The arrows are not meant to represent the
whole nor the full extent of the migrations from
any particular centre, but only in so far as they
affect our islands. Moreover, it would be impossible
to indicate on one map the geographical
conditions which obtained during the several migrations.
It must be remembered that during the time
which elapsed while they passed into the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Islands, these were joined in the north to Scandinavia
and in the south to Belgium and France. The various
phases of geographical evolution of Europe will be
studied in the subsequent chapters, and maps will
then be given to show as far as possible in a
general way the leading characteristics of these
great changes.</p>

<p>I have now given some reasons for the belief that
several different migrations of animals entered the
British Islands in later Tertiary times. I have also
shown why some of them must be looked upon as
being older than others, and in so far we have come
to a decision as to their relative ages. It still remains
for us, however, to examine how their geological ages
can be approximately determined. We require for
this purpose palæontological aid.</p>

<p>In the fifth chapter will be found the history of
the Siberian migration. And since we possess most
valuable records of it in the numerous fossil remains
discovered in Central and Western Europe, we are
able to trace their progress from the east to the
west in a very complete and satisfactory manner. In
England their first appearance dates from the Forest-Bed,
for here we find remains of the Glutton (<i>Gulo
luscus</i>), Musk-Ox (<i>Ovibos moschatus</i>), and others (see
p. <a href="#Page_204">204</a>). It seems reasonable to suppose, therefore,
that the first entry of these Siberian mammals into
Europe took place at or just before the Forest-Bed
period. But Professor Nehring tells us in his remarkable
work on the Tundra and Steppes (p. 222), that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Germany the remains of the same mammals occur in
deposits which are certainly more recent than the
lower continental boulder clay; and he is inclined to
the belief that they migrated into Europe during the
inter-glacial phase which is supposed to have separated
the earlier from the later stage of the Glacial period.
It is evident that in this case the inter-glacial period
in Germany would have corresponded to, and be contemporaneous
with, our Forest-Bed period. The
deposits immediately preceding the Forest-Bed would
also be contemporaneous with the lower continental
boulder clay. Although this may seem rather a
startling statement to make, from the evidence
which will be brought forward in the fourth and
fifth chapters I am inclined to the belief that such
is probably the case.</p>

<p>Having once arrived at a determination of the
exact geological period during which the Siberian
mammals invaded our continent, and having also
previously determined the relative ages of the various
other migrations, we have advanced another step in
the direction we are aiming at. Let us suppose that
the Siberian migration actually reached the British
Islands during the Forest-Bed period. Since the
Siberian migration is the most recent of those which
entered the British Islands, the others must have
commenced their march before the Forest-Bed
period. Now it was Professor Boyd Dawkins who
first indicated to us, as I have remarked before,
the method of research to be adopted in an attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
to determine the geological age of the different
migrations in so far as they affected the British
Islands. I may be excused, therefore, for again
quoting the following important passage in one of
his works. "The absence," he says (<i>b</i>, p. xxix), "of
the beaver and the dormouse from Ireland must be
due to the existence of some barrier to their westward
migration from the adjacent mainland, and the fact
that the Alpine hare is indigenous, while the common
hare is absent, implies that, so far as relates to the
former animal, the barrier did not exist." The Beaver,
Dormouse, and Common Hare are either Siberians or
later migrants from elsewhere, and there can be no
doubt that at the Forest-Bed period Ireland was
already, or was just being, separated from England.
All the southern species, that is to say all the
Lusitanian, Alpine, and Oriental forms occurring in
Ireland, must therefore be older than that period. I
have advocated similar views in a former essay on
this subject. Mr. Carpenter recently advanced some
interesting and valuable criticisms on these views,
which we may examine a little more closely (p. 385).
"While, then," he remarks, "I find myself in almost
complete agreement with Dr. Scharff with regard to
the older sections of our fauna, I think that those
widespread species which survived the Glacial period
must have been confined to the more southern parts
of our area, and have only subsequently spread
northwards and westwards to Scotland and Ireland."
He suggests, in fact, that the widespread British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
species belong to a younger or newer section of our
fauna than the local ones. In many cases this may
be quite true, but we possess also a large number of
common and widely-spread forms which bear the
impress of antiquity upon them. We have the most
positive proof of the antiquity of the very common
small circular Snail (<i>Helix rotundata</i>), since it was
found in miocene freshwater deposits near Bordeaux.
Many other examples might be mentioned
to show that, though discontinuous range is generally
a proof of antiquity, continuous range is not always a
sign of the opposite. Some species, in fact, appear to
be short-lived and disinclined to spread, whilst others
multiply rapidly even under a change of temperature
and climate, and are to be found almost everywhere.
But even if we supposed, with Mr. Carpenter, that
these widely-ranging species must have been confined
during the Glacial period to the more southern parts
of England, the idea that they afterwards made their
way northwards along the eastern shore of the Irish
Sea and then passed into Ireland, does not appeal to
me. Southern England was occupied at that very
same time by an assemblage of Siberian mammals.
Mr. Carpenter thinks these might have been kept
out of Ireland by an arm of the sea until the land-connection
with North-western England had broken
down. But if an arm of the sea could keep out the
Siberian mammals it would also keep out the widely-spread
British species of the general fauna. On the
other hand, I quite admit that my view of the survival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
in Ireland of the pre-glacial fauna is somewhat
difficult to accept, considering that we have such
undoubted evidence of a very extensive submergence.
The case of Isle of Man, quoted by Mr. Carpenter,
can be met, I think, by the supposition that it was
connected with Cumberland until quite recently, and
quite independently of any connection between England
and Ireland; that the Isle of Man, in fact,
was always a cape or peninsula of the mainland, and
only recently became separated by local subsidences
or by the action of the sea.</p>

<p>Part of the history of the British fauna will be
referred to again in the next chapter, which deals
with the Arctic migration. We need not therefore
dwell any longer on this subject here. There is one
matter, however, which is of importance in connection
with the geographical conditions of the British Islands
at the time when the greater portion of our fauna
arrived from abroad.</p>

<p>On page <a href="#Page_60">60</a> will be found a map indicating the
physical geography of that part of the ancient continent
on which what are now the British Islands were
situated. Only one large river has been marked on
that map, namely, that flowing out of a lake which
occupied part of the Irish Sea. Another probably discharged
its waters into the Atlantic midway between
France and England, whilst the Thames may have
been a tributary of the Rhine, as it emptied itself
into the sea near our south-east coast. I have shown
in a previous essay that the former presence of a freshwater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>lake between England and Ireland is indicated
by the distribution of the Charrs and also by the
various species of British Coregonus. There are
three British species of Coregonus, viz., <i>C. clupeoides</i>,
<i>C. vandesius</i>, and <i>C. pollan</i>. These are confined to
the lakes of North Wales, North-western England,
South-western Scotland, and Ireland. All but the
latter communicate at present directly with the Irish
Sea. The lakes of the latter country, however, must
have done so at a time when the west of Ireland
stood at a higher level than it does now. The
ancestors of the three Coregonus species, and also
those of the Charrs, then lived in the large freshwater
lake indicated on the map (p. <a href="#Page_60">60</a>), and when the sea
gradually crept up the river valley and finally converted
the lake into a gulf, the freshwater fish took
refuge in the rivers which supplied it with water.</p>

<p>Now as for the continuous sea-shore between the
coast of Brittany and the south-west of Ireland,
zoological distribution again aids us in proving that
such must have actually existed at no very distant
geological date. Most of our common shore forms
of life migrate along the coast exactly as land
animals do&mdash;step by step. Their eggs are carefully
attached to fixed objects, so as not to be
carried away by the waves, whilst the young often
remain and grow old in some particular little pool,
rarely venturing farther than a few yards from the spot
where they first saw the light of day. A number of
such shore forms are found on the west coast of France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
the same species recurring again on the south-west
coasts of England and Ireland, thus clearly indicating
a former continuity of coast-line between these points,
now separated by deep sea. A very familiar example
to British zoologists is the purple rock-boring Sea-urchin
(<i>Strongylocentrotus lividus</i>), but there are a
great many others, such as the semi-marine Beetles
<i>Octhebius Lejolisii</i> and <i>Æpophilus Bonnairei</i>, the
Crustaceans <i>Achæus Cranchii</i>, <i>Inachus leptochirus</i>,
<i>Gonoplax angulata</i>, <i>Thia assidua</i>, <i>Callianassa subterranea</i>,
the Fishes <i>Blennius galerita</i> and <i>Lepadogaster
Decandollii</i>, and the Molluscs <i>Otina otis</i>,
<i>Donax politus</i>, and <i>Amphidesma castaneum</i>.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter, a few words as to
my views on the conditions prevailing during the
Glacial period will not be out of place. They do not
differ very much from those held formerly by most
geologists; and even at present there are, as I have
mentioned before, a few upholders of those older
views.</p>

<p>The sea, I think, must have gradually crept across
England from the east during, or shortly after, the
Forest-Bed period, so as to separate the south from
the north, whilst Ireland and Scotland were then still
connected with one another. At a later stage, the sea
also partially invaded Ireland, and this condition is
very roughly represented on the accompanying map.
Mr. Kendall kindly drew my attention to the fact
that several notable areas on which shelly drift has
been observed are here placed upon the land; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
it must be remembered that one stage only can be
shown on the map, and that the sea covered more
ground a little later. Many of the smaller islands in
the glacial sea, too, are not shown. The map, in fact,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
is merely meant to give a general idea of the manner
in which the great northern sea moved westward and
slowly covered a large portion of the British Islands.
These peculiar geographical conditions explain, I
think, better than anything, the absence from parts
of the Midlands and the north of England of
such a number of terrestrial invertebrates which
are otherwise widely distributed over the British
Islands. In spite of the fact that a large portion
of the British Islands became submerged, we
possessed at that time an extensive area which
has since been claimed by the sea, so that there
was ample room for the present fauna to survive
the Glacial period. The climate during this period
was probably much the same as it is at present,
though moister, with cooler summers and milder
winters.</p>

manner the sea may have invaded the country from the east during,
or shortly after, the Forest-Bed period. The darkly shaded
parts indicate the areas covered by water, and the lightly shaded
and white portions what was land at that time.</p>

<p>It may be asked what proof we have of such an
extensive submergence of England and Ireland. My
own views are principally based on the general
distribution of the fauna in the British Islands, and
the belief that nothing but a mild climate during the
Glacial period could have brought it about. On
purely geological grounds, however, some geologists,
notably Mr. Mellard Reade, have come to a similar
conclusion. "The whole of Lancashire and Cheshire,"
he remarks (<i>a</i>, p. 542), "from sea-level up to about
400 feet, and in places 600 feet, is covered by a
continuous mantle of boulder-clay and sands."
"These clays, as a rule, contain distributed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
them, in a greater or less degree, fragments of shells
and some perfect ones. I myself have recorded
forty-four species." Again he continues (pp. 545
and 546): "A large part of Ayrshire is covered with
similar shelly boulder-clays from sea-level to 1061
feet at Dippal. These Ayrshire high-level shells
have, in the majority of cases, been taken, not from
sand and gravel beds, but from boulder-clay, and in
that respect they are most important and unique.
In Moel Tryfan the shells are found in sands and
gravels at 982 feet; on the range of hills from Miaera
to Llangollen from 1000-1200 feet; also in sands and
gravels at Gloppa, near Oswestry, at 1100-1200 feet;
and near Macclesfield at a level of about 1200 feet.
In Ireland marine shells can be traced almost from
sea-level to a height of over 1000 feet."</p>

<p>"Again," continues the same author, "if we look
broadly at the distribution of these shelly deposits,
we find that they occur all round our maritime coasts
in Lancashire, Cheshire, and Wales, in Cumberland
and Westmoreland, Wigtonshire and Ayrshire, and
along the eastern coast of Ireland. The same is
to be said of the eastern coasts of England and
Scotland."</p>

<p>That a very considerable change of sea-level has
taken place in some parts of the British Islands would
appear to a zoologist the most logical conclusion after
an examination of these "high-level shelly sands and
gravels," but the shells contained in them are now
generally supposed to have been carried there frozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
in the sole of a glacier or pushed up in front of it.
The older view, however, which agrees so much better
with the facts of distribution, fortunately has not
disappeared among geologists. "When we call up,"
says Mr. Mellard Reade (<i>b</i>, p. 435), "before our
mental vision the simple and well-known facts of
nature which suffice to explain the marine drifts on
the theory of submergence, it seems unnecessary
to resort to the ingenious and artificial system of
physics elaborated to explain the phenomena of
land-ice."</p>

<p>"When we have more knowledge of the glaciers
of the Arctic Regions, and facts, in place of
ingenious suppositions, to base our reasoning upon,
we may possibly have to revise all our glacial conceptions.
In the meantime, the submergence theory
of the origin of high-level shelly gravels and sands
seems to me by far the simpler of the two theories,
and the most consistent with the facts and phenomena
which the labours of a succession of enthusiastic geologists
have made us acquainted with."</p>

<p>Among those geologists, and they form the majority,
who hold that Ireland was covered by land-ice, there is
a great diversity of opinion as to its extent. Messrs.
Close, Kinahan, J. Geikie, and others believe that
the ice covered practically everything, whilst others
who claim to have examined the ground with equal
care, such as Professor Carvill Lewis, were led to
believe that the south of Ireland, with the exception
of a few local glaciers, was free from ice. The glacial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
phenomena of the country can therefore be interpreted
in different ways, even by those who are
convinced that they are due to land-ice and not to
icebergs or mud-glaciers.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER III.</h3>

<p>The history of the British fauna is not only of interest to us
from a sentimental point of view, it is a convenient starting-point
in the study of the larger European problem. The fauna,
broadly speaking, is composed of three foreign elements, viz., the
northern, eastern, and southern, to which may be added a small
endemic one. Examples are given of the more noteworthy forms
belonging to each of these. This leads us to the subject of the
natural divisions of the British Islands according to their animal
inhabitants. Zoologists attempted at first to subdivide these
countries, on the lines laid down by botanists, into a large
number of provinces. Forbes proposed ten such divisions for
mollusca, and subsequently five, which were ultimately reduced
by others to two or three.</p>

<p>The opinions of biologists are almost unanimous in attributing
the bulk of the British fauna and flora to migrations by land
from the Continent, but two other theories, viz., those of Professor
Cole and Messrs. Kinahan and Lamplugh, are also
referred to. The first believes in a possible migration eastward
from Western Europe, and the latter support the view of the
former existence of ice-bridges to assist the fauna in their
migrations.</p>

<p>An endeavour is next made to determine at what geological
periods the various migrations entered the British Islands.
There is considerable difference of opinion on this subject.
Some believe that the British fauna is altogether post-glacial;
a few think that it is partly so and the remainder glacial;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
others again hold that a portion is pre-glacial and the rest
glacial and post-glacial. Those who have studied the subject
most closely feel convinced that the south-western or Lusitanian
fauna, and also the flora, must have arrived before the Glacial
period and survived the latter in these Islands. It seems
reasonable to suppose, therefore, that the climate cannot
have been very severe during the so-called Ice-Age. This
Lusitanian fauna must be looked upon as the oldest portion of the
British fauna. The Alpine and Oriental migrations arrived next.
After these came the Arctic, and finally the Eastern or Siberian.
As the fossil evidence is most complete with regard to the last,
we are able to determine with precision not only the direction
whence this migration came, but approximately its geological
age. It arrived in Germany from the east after the
deposition of the lower boulder-clay. Since the boulder-clay
is looked upon as a glacial deposit, the Siberian migration
reached Central Europe after the first portion of the Glacial
period had passed. In England it makes its first appearance
in the Forest-Bed, which would therefore correspond to the
"Loess" formation of Central Europe. All the other migrations
are older than the Siberian. They must therefore have come
to Great Britain during the earlier part of the Glacial period
or before it.</p>

<p>The chapter concludes with a short statement on the physical
geography of the British Islands during the time when these
migrations entered them. That there existed a continuous
coast-line between France and Ireland is proved by the
occurrence of a considerable number of identical shore
species, whilst the former existence of a freshwater lake on
the site of the present Irish Sea is indicated by the distribution
of some freshwater fishes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />

THE ARCTIC FAUNA.</h2>


<p>The lands lying within the Polar Circle are inhabited
by an assemblage of animals and plants, many of
which are peculiar to those regions. They are mostly
adapted to the abnormal conditions of life prevailing
in the high latitudes of our globe&mdash;the long, dark
winters, and the short summers of one long day.
Though the numbers of species and of individuals are
few, there is a keen struggle for existence in those
regions. The prevailing colour of the ground is white,
and since a resemblance in the colour of an animal
to the ground it lives on acts as a protection to weak
ones, and also enables Carnivores to approach their
prey with greater facility, it is not surprising that we
should find the majority of polar animals coloured
white. As I remarked, the polar area contains a very
distinct set of species; most of them, however, range
beyond the confines of the Arctic Circle. It is therefore
scarcely justifiable to raise this Arctic area into a
distinct zoological region equivalent to the great zoogeographic
regions, which have been established by
Sclater and Wallace, though we might, with Dr.
Brauer, look upon it as a sub-region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p><p>There are six typical Polar Land-mammals, one of
which, the Polar Bear, is semi-aquatic. The Reindeer
(<i>Rangifer tarandus</i>) occurs upon almost all the polar
lands, and it has often been a source of speculation
in what manner it has reached such remote islands as
Spitsbergen and Novaya Zemlya&mdash;the former of the
two being so remote from a continent. There is no
doubt that Reindeer are great wanderers, owing to
the difficulty of finding sufficient food-supply for the
large herds in which they are accustomed to travel;
and for this reason they can cross, and have been
known to cross, distances of from ten to twenty miles
on ice. The Behring Straits, when frozen over in
winter, is frequently traversed by them. But I quite
agree with Dr. Brauer (p. 260) that it is impossible to
account for their presence in Spitsbergen by an immigration
from either Novaya Zemlya, Greenland, or
Scandinavia, under the present geographical conditions.
The seas between the former island and
the other land-masses referred to are rarely entirely
frozen over. Even if this should occur, the distances
between Spitsbergen and Greenland, Novaya
Zemlya, or Scandinavia are so great, that a migration
across ice is quite excluded from the range of possibilities,
since Reindeer could not subsist without
food during the time it would take to travel from
one to the other. The manner in which it did reach
Spitsbergen and Greenland will be discussed more
fully below, and I will therefore proceed to mention
the other Arctic mammals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p><p>One of the most important and most typical species
is the Polar Bear (<i>Ursus maritimus</i>), the greater part
of whose life is spent on the ice and in the sea. The
fact that its favourite nourishment consists of seals
proves its excellent and keen faculties of sight and
hearing, and its facility in swimming. But it is not a
dainty feeder, and lives upon almost all animals which
come within its reach; birds, land-mammals, or fish
are not despised in times of scarcity. Its fur throughout
the year is coloured white, though in old bears it
assumes a more yellowish hue.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span>&mdash;The Musk-Ox (<i>Ovibos moschatus</i>). (From Flower &amp; Lydekker's
<i>Mammals</i>, p. 358. London: Adam &amp; Chas. Black.)</p>

<p>Another large mammal, perhaps less well known,
is the Musk-Ox (<i>Ovibos moschatus</i>, <a href="#Figure07">Fig. 7</a>), which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
resembles in size the smaller varieties of Oxen, but in
structure and habits is closely allied to the Sheep. As
is implied by the specific name, it exhales a musky
odour; this does not, however, appear to be due to
the secretion of a special gland, as is the case in other
animals with a similar smell. The skin is covered
with long brown thickly-matted hair, interspersed
with white. It is confined to the most northerly
parts of North America and the American Arctic
islands, and to North Greenland. Though not now
living in the Old World, it seems formerly to have
been abundant in Siberia, and, as we shall learn later
on, it was one of the species which took part in the
great Siberian invasion of Europe. Its remains have
been found not only in Germany and France, but also
in the south of England.</p>

<p>The Polar Fox (<i>Canis lagopus</i>) occurs throughout
the Polar Regions, and on islands where even the
Reindeer and the Musk-Ox are unknown. Beyond
the Polar Circle, its range extends into Northern
Asia, to the extreme north of North America, and the
mountains of Scandinavia. Like its congeners, it
had in pleistocene times a more southerly extension,
and fossil remains have been met with in various
parts of continental Europe and in England.</p>

<p>The Stoat (<i>Mustela erminea</i>), which is known and
much valued in commerce under the name of Ermine,
was formerly believed to occur only in Arctic America
and the northern parts of the Old World, but in more
recent years it has been discovered in a number of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
the northern islands, such as Saghalien, in the islands
of the Behring Straits, the Aleutian islands, and also
in Greenland and Spitsbergen. In Europe, it is found
as far south as the Arctic Hare, or perhaps even
farther, and it flourishes in the Alps up to a height
of 9000 feet. It offers a parallel to the Arctic Hare
in the fact that in some countries, such as Ireland, it
only rarely turns white in winter. The Irish form of
the Stoat differs so much from the English, that
Messrs. Thomas and Barrett-Hamilton are of opinion
that it is specifically distinct, as I mentioned in
speaking of the divisions of the British fauna
(p. <a href="#Page_90">90</a>).</p>

<p>The Arctic Hare (<i>Lepus variabilis</i>) is almost the
only one of the typical Arctic mammals which still
inhabits the British Islands, and for that reason it is
to most of us more familiar than any of the preceding
species. Hares have been described from Greenland
by the name of <i>Lepus glacialis</i>, from the
European Alps as <i>Lepus alpinus</i>, and under other
names from Arctic North America; but though slight
differences in the fur and even in the skull can be
pointed out, there is no doubt that all these are only
varieties or races of what, in the British Islands, is
known as the Irish or the Scotch Mountain Hare,
<i>Lepus variabilis</i>. In the Arctic Regions this Hare
remains white throughout the year, but in Scandinavia
and some other parts its fur becomes brown
in the summer, and in Ireland it frequently remains
entirely brown during the whole year, and never, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
only in very rare cases, becomes entirely white in
winter. Besides Scandinavia, Scotland, and Ireland,
it is found in Northern Russia, and also in the
Pyrenees, the Alps, and the Caucasus. In Asia it
occurs not only on the mainland of Siberia, but it has
been obtained on the Akita Mountains in Japan and
on the Mioko San Mountain, and also on the island
of Saghalien. It had in former times a more extensive
range, and its remains have been discovered in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
England and in a number of places on the continent
of Europe. The peculiarity of its range, which will
be explained more fully directly, lies in the fact of
the occurrence of isolated colonies in the mountains
of Europe, in Ireland and Scotland, and in the
mountains of Japan (<a href="#Figure08">Fig. 8</a>). From a distributional
point of view, it is one of the most interesting species
of mammals, and its history throws a flood of light
on the geographical changes which have occurred in
former times.</p>

distribution of the Arctic Hare (<i>Lepus variabilis</i>) indicated in
black.</p>

<p>One more species must be mentioned, and that is
the Banded Lemming (<i>Cuniculus torquatus</i>), which
occurs chiefly in Arctic America, Northern Siberia,
and Greenland. Though frequently mistaken for the
Scandinavian Lemming, there is a striking difference
in the character of the teeth, which has induced
zoologists to put them into distinct genera. The
Arctic Lemming, moreover, is distinguished from
the Scandinavian by the absence of external ears, the
densely furred feet, and by the great length of the two
middle claws in the fore-feet. There are two species
of the true Lemming, namely, the one just referred to,
<i>Myodus lemmus</i>, and <i>Myodus obensis</i>. These may be
looked upon as more or less Arctic species, since they
occur within the Polar Circle, but they are not so
exclusively confined to that region as the Banded
Lemming (<i>Cuniculus torquatus</i>). The remains of
both <i>Cuniculus torquatus</i> and of <i>Myodus lemmus</i> have
been found in British pleistocene deposits.</p>

<p>Until recently no Lemming remains had been found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
to the south of France, but Mr. Barrett-Hamilton
announced to us a short time since that Dr. Gadow
had discovered some skeletons with their skins still
preserved in a cave in Northern Portugal. These
were found to belong to the Scandinavian Lemming
(<i>M. lemmus</i>), and the author incidentally expressed the
opinion that there was some possibility of this species
still inhabiting the mountains of Spain.</p>

<p>The Lemming multiplies with great rapidity under
favourable conditions. In speaking of his experiences
in Siberia Dr. Brehm says (p. 79): "All the young of
the first litter of the various Lemming females thrive,
and six weeks later at the most these also multiply.
Meanwhile the parents have brought forth a second
and a third litter, and these in their turn bring forth
young. Within three months the heights and low
grounds of the tundra teem with lemmings, just as
our fields do with mice under similar circumstances.
Whichever way we turn we see the busy little creatures,
dozens at a single glance, thousands in the course
of an hour. But the countless and still increasing
numbers prove their own destruction. Soon the lean
tundra ceases to afford employment enough for their
greedy teeth. Famine threatens, perhaps actually sets
in. The anxious animals crowd together and begin
their march, hundreds join with hundreds, thousands
with other thousands, the troops become swarms, the
swarms armies. They travel in a definite direction,
at first following old tracks, but soon striking out
new ones; in unending files&mdash;defying all computation&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>hasten onwards; over the cliffs they plunge
into the water. Thousands fall victims to want and
hunger; the army behind streams on over their
corpses; hundreds of thousands are drowned in the
water or are shattered at the foot of the cliffs; the
remainder speed on; other hundreds and thousands
fall victims to the voracity of Arctic and red foxes,
wolves and gluttons, rough-legged buzzards and
ravens, owls and skuas which have followed them;
the survivors pay no heed. Where these go, how they
end, none can say; but certain it is, that the tundra
behind them is as if dead, that a number of years
pass ere the few who have remained behind and have
managed to survive slowly multiply and visibly re-people
their native fields." This eloquent passage
reminds us of the manner in which migrations of
all kinds of animals have taken place in former times,
and are still taking place. It is principally want
of food which compels them to search for new
homes.</p>

<p>On page <a href="#Page_91">91</a> I have referred to some birds which
have come to us from the north. One of these, the
Snow Bunting (<i>Plectrophenax nivalis</i>), is a typically
Arctic species. In summer it is widely distributed,
and is found in Spitsbergen, Novaya Zemlya, Siberia,
and the Arctic Regions generally. In winter it
migrates down into North America, into Japan,
Northern China, Turkestan, Southern Russia, and
occasionally even across Europe into North Africa.
Very characteristic Arctic birds are the Eider Ducks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
belonging to the genus <i>Somateria</i>. Three species
have visited the British Islands. The common Eider
Duck (<i>S. mollissima</i>), which is of such high commercial
value, is abundant in Norway and northward,
throughout the Polar Regions. The appearance of
the King Eider (<i>S. spectabilis</i>) on our coasts is an
extremely rare occurrence, and even in Norway it is
only known as a visitor, but on Novaya Zemlya and
along the Arctic shores of Siberia, in Greenland and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Arctic North America, it is known to breed. The
third species, Steller's Eider (<i>S. Stelleri</i>), seems to be
still rarer, and only in the Aleutian islands and in the
north of Alaska can it be said to be at all abundant.
It is probable that the famous Great Auk (<i>Alca
impennis</i>, <a href="#Figure09">Fig. 9</a>) also was a typical Arctic species.
Its range extended to both sides of the Atlantic. In
Newfoundland and on the coast of Iceland it is known
to have been met with in considerable numbers
within historic times; and no doubt, like all Arctic
species, it extended farther southwards at a more
remote period.</p>

</div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9.</span>&mdash;The Great Auk (<i>Alca impennis</i>).</p>

<p>The members of the genus <i>Lagopus</i>, including the
various species of Grouse, are likewise of northern
origin. The British Red Grouse (<i>L. scoticus</i>), which
may be looked upon as a form of the Scandinavian
Willow Grouse (<i>L. albus</i>) (compare p. <a href="#Page_91">91</a>), constitutes
in some respects a curious case of parallelism with
the Arctic Hare, since the latter, in its more southern
station, generally retains the summer fur throughout
the year. The allied Ptarmigan (<i>L. mutus</i>) inhabits
Scandinavia, the Ural Mountains, and some of the
Asiatic mountain ranges. It is also found in the
European Alps and in the Pyrenees. The North
European range of the Ptarmigan suggests that
we are dealing with an ancient species which came
south from the Arctic Regions at about the same
time as the Arctic Hare; but it is more probable,
as I have shown in a subsequent chapter (p. <a href="#Page_334">334</a>),
that this species has entered Europe more recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
with the Siberian migrants from Central Asia, where
indeed the genus had its original home. The Black
Cock (<i>Tetrao tetrix</i>) and the Capercaillie (<i>Tetrao
urogallus</i>) have also come to us from the east,
and have even penetrated into Ireland. They are
therefore some of the few instances of members
of the Siberian invasion having become temporarily
established there.</p>

<p>Reptiles and amphibia are altogether unknown in
the Polar Regions, but a large number of fish, chiefly
marine, have taken their origin there. The Salmon
family are of Arctic origin, as also are the Sticklebacks
and the Perches, many of the Cod family, the
Herrings, and several of the Flat fish.</p>

<p>It would lead me too far to refer to the invertebrate
fauna of the Polar Regions, but a few remarks on the
Arctic plants may not be out of place.</p>

<p>The principal Arctic genera are Salix, Ranunculus,
Draba, Pedicularis, Potentilla, Saxifraga, Carex,
Juncus, Luzula, Eriophorum, and others.</p>

<p>Among the most characteristic Arctic plants may
be mentioned <i>Dryas octopetala</i>, to which I have already
referred as occurring in the west of Ireland; <i>Saxifraga
oppositifolia</i>, another British species, occurs in the
higher mountains of Scotland, Ireland, and Wales;
<i>Braya alpina</i>, <i>Papaver nudicaule</i>, <i>Lychnis apetala</i>,
<i>Diapensia lapponica</i>, and <i>Lobelia Dortmanna</i>, which is
found in the lakes of Scotland and Ireland. The
dwarf birch (<i>Betula nana</i>) also, which still occurs
in Scotland and the North of England, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
had formerly a wider range in the British Islands,
should be included among these; but there are other
plants probably of Arctic origin, though not now
occurring in the Arctic Regions, and to these may
be classed the so-called American species of plants
which are found on the northern and western coasts
of Ireland, in the Hebrides, in Scotland, and in
North America. These are no doubt the relics of an
Arctic flora which flourished in high latitudes in past
times when the climate there was more temperate.
A list of these species will be found on page <a href="#Page_166">166</a>.</p>

<p>As none of them occur in Siberia, they must
either have found their way to North America and
to Europe from the Arctic Regions, or have travelled
from North America across the latter to Europe.
In any case a former land-connection between the
two continents must have existed. This becomes
the more evident when we examine the remarkable
results obtained by the late Professor Heer, who first
described the Tertiary plant-beds in North Greenland.
No less than 282 species of plants have been described
by this eminent botanist from these deposits. A large
number of the plants found were trees belonging to
the genus <i>Sequoia</i>, <i>Thujopsis</i>, and <i>Salisburia</i>, besides
beeches, oaks, planes, poplars, limes, and magnolias.
That they grew on the spot is proved by the fruits,
which have been obtained from these beds in various
stages of growth.</p>

<p>From a similar deposit in Spitsbergen a large
number of fossil plants have also been brought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
light, many of which are identical with those found
in Greenland; and some of the Greenland forms
(such as <i>Taxodium distichum</i> and <i>Sequoia Langsdorfii</i>)
have been found too in Alaska, showing that there
was probably a continuity of land between Spitsbergen
and North America by way of Greenland.
Two species of <i>Sequoias</i>, namely, <i>S. sempervirens</i>
and <i>S. gigantea</i>, the well-known Californian giant
trees, are very closely allied to the Greenland forms
discovered by Professor Heer.</p>

<p>Heer assigned the Arctic plant-bearing beds to the
Miocene epoch, but doubts have been recently thrown
upon this opinion by Mr. Starkie Gardner, who
brought forward arguments in support of his theory
of their being of the Eocene age. Professor Heer,
however, was able to meet these criticisms, and he is
ably supported in his views by Professor Engler and
other eminent continental botanists.</p>

<p>It is evident that under the present conditions of
temperature none of those plants could have flourished
in Greenland. The climate must have been much
milder than it is at present. Professor Heer estimated
from the general aspect of the fossil flora that the
mean annual temperature of North Greenland was
at least nine degrees centigrade, and that the mean
winter temperature was not below zero.</p>

<p>It will hardly be necessary for me to review here
the various theories which have been advanced by
geologists and botanists to account for this remarkably
high temperature in such northern latitudes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Any one who has read the writings of the late Dr.
Croll cannot help being struck by the facts he adduces
to show the importance of ocean currents in relation
to the distribution of heat over the globe, and it seems
to me that the view which attributes the mild climate
prevailing in former times in Greenland to warm
ocean currents reaching the Polar Circle is the
one least open to serious objections. If we suppose
that the North Atlantic Ocean was bridged by a
land-connection between Scandinavia and Greenland
by way of Spitsbergen, and between Greenland and
North America, the Polar Ocean would be practically
a closed sea. If, then, a wide passage existed somewhere
about Behring Straits to allow a warm current
to enter and circulate within the Arctic Seas, we
should have the southern shores of Greenland washed
by the warm Atlantic current and the northern shores
by a warm Pacific current, which combination would
undoubtedly produce the effect of raising the temperature
throughout the Polar Regions very considerably;
and especially would that be the case
with regard to Greenland and the neighbouring
islands.</p>

<p>It might be urged that the constant darkness
during winter must have had an injurious action
upon the flora, but it is found that in countries
such as Northern Russia, where southern plants are
housed during winter in greenhouses, the light being
almost entirely excluded by a covering of straw, no
serious damage is done thereby to the plants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p><p>It seems probable that a similar gradual refrigeration
of climate in northern latitudes has taken place
after Miocene times as has been proved to have
occurred in Europe.</p>

<p>Some years ago Dr. Haacke propounded the hypothesis
that the centre of creation of all the larger
groups of animals was situated in the region of the
North Pole, and that the newly originated groups must
always push the older ones farther and farther south
into the most remote corners of the earth. As
instances of the correctness of his view he quotes
the fact that the more ancient mammals, such as
Monotremes, Marsupials, Lemurs, Edentates, and
Insectivores, all inhabit the more southerly parts
of the world. The Apteryx, Moa, Rhea, and the
Ostrich, as well as Æpyornis, which is only recently
extinct, are found in the same regions. But we have
no palæontological evidence in favour of these extravagant
views. Fossil Edentates and Marsupials
are almost entirely confined to the Southern Hemisphere,
and the supposition that because these
primitive mammals inhabit the extreme south of our
great continental land-masses, they therefore came
from the north, cannot be said to be an argument.
Nevertheless, I am quite with Dr. Haacke in considering
that the North Pole, or, we might say, the lands
within the Arctic Circle, have been the place of
origin of some of our European mammals, and there
can be no doubt that certain species in other groups,
among invertebrates and also plants, have originated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
in the Polar Regions. The facts of geographical
distribution teach us that in these regions there has
been a centre of origin within comparatively recent
geological times. I have on a previous occasion
drawn attention to the range of the Reindeer: that
it lives almost throughout the Polar lands, and that it
spreads into North America, Northern Europe, and
Northern Asia. We have, again, fossil proof that its
range extended down to the Pyrenees in Europe in
pleistocene times. But there is not a scrap of
evidence that it ever during any time occurred
farther south, either in Europe, Asia, or North
America. Its original home must therefore have
been in the Polar Regions, for if it had originated
either in Central Europe, Asia, or America, there is no
reason why it should not, in the natural course of
events, have extended its range to the south as well
as to the north.</p>

<p>The Arctic Hare presents us with a very similar
case of distribution. Like the Reindeer, it inhabits, as
we have learned, the Polar Regions and the northerly
parts of the Old World and the New; but while we
have only fossil evidence of the former, more southerly,
extension of the range of the Reindeer, the Arctic Hare
furnishes us with a still stronger proof of its past
southward range in the survival of small isolated
colonies in some of the southern mountain ranges of
Europe and Asia. It is generally believed that the
occurrence of the Arctic Hare in these southern mountains
is a standing testimony to the severity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
climate at the time when it commenced its southerly
increase of range, but I have already shown that the
climate of Europe at that time was not necessarily
colder than it is at present, but that it may have been
somewhat milder (p. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>). I think that a vast increase
of ice in the Polar Regions has taken place only at a
comparatively recent date, and that both the Reindeer
and the Arctic Hare originated there during a much
more temperate climate than obtains at present.
A great sensation was produced among European
zoologists and anthropologists when the discovery
was first announced that the remains of the Reindeer
had been found in the Pyrenees, and it naturally gave
rise to many speculations as to the nature of the
climate at the time when its range extended so far
south.<a name="FNanchor_1_6" id="FNanchor_1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_6" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The greater number of our best authorities
are still of opinion that the existence of the Reindeer
in Southern Europe points to the prevalence of an
arctic climate in that region. It is generally overlooked,
however, that the Reindeer-remains occur in
company with many typically southern animals, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
if they had been found alone, would have been held
to be a certain indication of a warm climate. The
French geologist Professor Lartet, indeed, was of
opinion that the temperature during the time when
the Reindeer lived in the Pyrenees must have been
rather milder than it is at present (compare pp. <a href="#Page_71">71</a>-<a href="#Page_75">75</a>).
Similarly, Mr. Harlé argues, that the extremely
cold climate probably did not extend to South-western
France, since that area only received occasional
visits from some of the representatives of the
Arctic fauna.</p>

<p>Long ago North American zoologists recognised
the existence in their country of two well-marked
races of the Reindeer (Caribou)&mdash;a smaller one with
rounded antlers (<a href="#Figure10">Fig. 10</a>), and a larger one in which
the antlers are more or less flattened out (<a href="#Figure11">Fig. 11</a>).
Two somewhat similar races can also be traced in the
fossil remains of the Reindeer in Europe. It was, I
think, Gervais who first pointed out that the Reindeer
remains from the north of France differed from those
found in the south; and Lartet referred to the fact
that the southern remains were more like what, in
America, is called the Barren-ground Caribou, while
those from Central European deposits all belonged to
the Siberian variety, which is more like the Woodland
Caribou of North America. In Ireland, Professor
Leith Adams also drew attention to the
curious fact that all the Irish Reindeer remains
resemble the Norwegian variety rather than the
Siberian; and Mr. Murray was so much struck by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
the close resemblance between the Spitsbergen and
Greenland forms with the Barren-ground Caribou, that
he based some speculations on a former land-connection
between these countries on this circumstance.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span>&mdash;Head of a Woodland Reindeer in the Dublin Museum
(photographed by Mr. McGoogan).</p>

<p>We have, therefore, records of the present or the
former existence of a Reindeer resembling the North
American Barren-ground form in Greenland, Spitsbergen,
Scandinavia, Ireland, and the South of
France. In England the remains of the two forms
occur mixed, but I do not know in how far either the
one or the other predominates. The Barren-ground
Reindeer is in Europe altogether confined to the
west; the most easterly locality that I am acquainted
with being Rixdorf, near Berlin. The majority of
the European remains of the Reindeer seem to
belong to the Siberian or Woodland variety, and it
would appear as if some intercrossing between the
two forms had occurred in Lapland, since it is stated
that in that country the Reindeer is somewhat intermediate
between the two. All the Asiatic remains
also resemble the Woodland variety.</p>

<p>As far as I know, no explanation has been
attempted to account for this peculiar range in
Europe of the two forms of Reindeer. But if we look
more closely into the mode of occurrence of the Reindeer
remains, we find that the Barren-ground form,
seems to have existed in Western Europe long before
the other variety made its appearance there. It was
pointed out by Struckmann that the Reindeer in
Southern Europe occurs in older deposits than in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the north. In speaking of the northern ones, he had of
course chiefly the German deposits in view. It is in
one of the oldest pleistocene deposits in Germany
that the isolated instance, referred to above, of the
occurrence of the Barren-ground Reindeer, near Berlin,
has been noted.</p>

<p>There is still a further point which illustrates the
supposition that the Barren-ground Reindeer was a
more ancient inhabitant of Europe than the Woodland
one. The latter in all Central European stations
(in fact almost wherever it occurs fossil) is associated
with the remains of the typical inhabitants
of Siberia, such as the Glutton, Sousliks, Lemmings,
and others; but in the deposits in which the Barren-ground
Reindeer have been found in South-western
France, no other Arctic mammal finds a place.
Again, in Irish deposits none of the Siberian
migrants are found. The only explanation of this
remarkable fact is that the two varieties of the
Reindeer have come to Europe by different routes.
We have learned already from the observations of
Mr. Murray that there are evidences of the existence
of a former land-connection between North America,
Greenland, and Spitsbergen. Professor Petersen
tells us that, according to recent surveys, a high
submarine plateau with a sharp fall of 1000 fathoms
towards the Atlantic Ocean begins from Northern
Norway and is continued as far as Spitsbergen.
Several islands, such as Bear Island, King Charles
Land, and others, arise from this plateau, and these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
must be looked upon as the remains of a sunken
land (<a href="#Figure12">Fig. 12</a>).</p>

<p>From Arctic America, thinks Professor Schulz
(p. 1), we probably have had an uninterrupted
migration during the greater part of later Tertiary
times up to the commencement of the Pliocene epoch&mdash;partly
over a direct land-connection between Greenland,
Iceland, and the Faroes, and also between Arctic
America, Spitsbergen, Franz Josef Land, etc. There
was also a connection between Asia and Alaska.</p>

<p>The distribution of the Barren-ground Reindeer in
Europe seems to warrant the belief that, at the time
it began its southward wanderings from the Polar
area, Northern Norway must have been connected
with Greenland in the manner just indicated, but,
as I shall explain later on, Russian Lapland and
part of Northern Russia, or the land between the
White Sea and the Baltic, must at that time have
been submerged by the sea. The greater part of
Denmark and the lowlands of Sweden were likewise
submerged, but Scandinavia extended south as far as
Scotland, while Scotland was connected with Ireland,
and the latter with England and France. The Reindeer
migrating south into Scandinavia could only
reach the continent of Europe by way of the British
Islands. It appeared there in the west and gradually
extended its range east, where, as I mentioned above,
it has occurred in a few isolated localities.</p>

<p>The advent of the Woodland form of the Reindeer
in Europe took place at a much later stage. It came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
as I indicated, with the hordes of Siberian migrants
which invaded Europe during what is known as the
Inter-glacial phase of the Glacial period. Scandinavia,
not being then directly connected with continental
Europe, was not accessible to it; neither
was Ireland, which had by that time become disconnected
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>from Great Britain. None of the Siberian
migrants seem to have been able to cross the River
Garonne, and we therefore find neither the Woodland
Reindeer nor any of the typical Siberian species
represented in the Pyrenean deposits.</p>

submerged (shaded) at the commencement of the Glacial period.
The light portions represent, approximately, the extent of the
land at that time.</p>

<p>The Woodland Reindeer persisted in continental
Europe until comparatively recent times, and it has
since made its way into Scandinavia across Northern
Russia, and probably mingled with the older stock of
the Barren-ground form. In the same way, it may
have come about that in the English pleistocene
deposits the remains of the two races occur.</p>

<p>In a recent contribution to our knowledge of the
deer tribe (<i>c</i>, p. 88), Mr. Lydekker suggests that the
former division of the Reindeer races into the two
forms of Woodland and Barren-ground Caribou, no
longer holds good. He now recognises no less than
six races, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li>Rangifer tarandus typicus.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left:1.5em;margin-right:1.5em;">"</span><span style="margin-left:1.5em;margin-right:1.5em;">"</span>spitzbergensis.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left:1.5em;margin-right:1.5em;">"</span><span style="margin-left:1.5em;margin-right:1.5em;">"</span>caribou.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left:1.5em;margin-right:1.5em;">"</span><span style="margin-left:1.5em;margin-right:1.5em;">"</span>terræ-novæ.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left:1.5em;margin-right:1.5em;">"</span><span style="margin-left:1.5em;margin-right:1.5em;">"</span>gr&oelig;nlandicus.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left:1.5em;margin-right:1.5em;">"</span><span style="margin-left:1.5em;margin-right:1.5em;">"</span>arcticus.</li>
</ol>

<p>I hardly think these can be considered of equal
value; indeed, though there may be differences
between <i>R. gr&oelig;nlandicus</i>, <i>typicus</i>, <i>arcticus</i>, and <i>spitzbergensis</i>,
the antlers exhibit a certain much closer
relationship among one another than to <i>R. terræ-novæ</i>
and <i>caribou</i>. But the whole subject is by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
means as well known as could be wished, and a very
careful comparative study of recent and fossil remains
of the Reindeer from various parts of the Old and
New Worlds is much needed to put our views on a
firmer basis.</p>

<p>The presence of the Arctic Hare in Ireland and
the absence of the common European Hare (<i>Lepus
europæus</i>) can be explained in a somewhat similar
manner. The Arctic Hare is the older of the two
species&mdash;corresponding with the Barren-ground Reindeer&mdash;and
the European Hare the newer one,
associating, like the Woodland Reindeer, in its
westward migration with Siberian animals, though
probably of Oriental origin.</p>

<p>Let us once more refer back again to the map on page
<a href="#Page_137">137</a> indicating the geographical distribution of the
Arctic Hare. Its discontinuous range and its isolated
position in the Alps, Pyrenees, and the Japanese
mountains, all tend to show that it is an ancient
species. Moreover, its presence in Ireland in the
plain as well as in the mountains, clearly points to the
fact that, in the British Islands at any rate, the Arctic
Hare was the first comer, and that subsequently the
European Hare invaded these countries. It probably
found Ireland then no longer accessible, having since
become separated from England. Again and again
do we find the statement repeated, that the presence
of the Arctic Hare in Europe is a clear proof of the
former prevalence in our continent of an Arctic climate.
But if so, why should this Hare at present live and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
thrive in Ireland, which has a particularly mild climate
in winter, and be absent from so many continental
stations where the temperature more resembles that
of its native home? If we suppose that the European
Hare migrated to Europe from the east, after the
Arctic Hare had become established in Western
Europe, and drove the latter into the mountains
or northward whenever the two came into contact,
we should have, it seems to me, a better explanation
of the range presented by the two species.
I was formerly of opinion that the European Hare
had come with the Siberian animals from Siberia,
but it appears to me more likely now, that it reached
our continent with the Oriental migrants, and only
then joined the Siberians in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>The evidence in favour of a former land-connection
between Scandinavia and Greenland, rests on many
other facts besides those already brought forward.
That some form of land-connection formerly existed
between Europe and Greenland is now indeed almost
universally accepted. That it was situated more to
the south between Scotland and Greenland is a supposition
which has been actively supported by many
leading authorities, but it seems to me that if such a
land-bridge existed, it must have been in very early
Tertiary times, whilst the northern one, such as I
have indicated, may have originated later and persisted
until a recent geological date.</p>

<p>The distribution of few groups of animals is now
better known than that of the larger butterflies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
moths (<i>Macro-lepidoptera</i>); even those of Siberia have
been fairly well investigated. The interesting facts obtainable
from their distribution are therefore of special
value. No less than 243 species of <i>Lepidoptera</i> are
mentioned by Möschler as being common to North
America and Europe. It is extremely probable that
a fair number of these have either migrated direct
from America to Europe or <i>vice versâ</i>, though many
may be of Asiatic origin, and have wandered east
and west from their original home. The following
twelve species are mentioned by Petersen (p. 38)
as occurring in Arctic Europe and also in Arctic
North America, but not in Asia:&mdash;<i>Colias nastes</i>,
<i>Colias hecla</i>, <i>Syrichthus centaureæ</i>, <i>Pachnobia carnea</i>,
<i>Plusia parilis</i>, <i>Anarta Richardsoni</i>, <i>Anarta Schönherri</i>,
<i>Anarta lapponica</i>, <i>Anarta Zetterstedti</i>, <i>Cidaria
frigidaria</i>, <i>Cidaria polata</i>, <i>Eupithecia hyperboreata</i>;
and these, as he remarks, point to the possibility
of a former direct land-connection between Europe
and North America.</p>

<p>Mr. Petersen believes that the chief immigration
into the Arctic area of Europe is post-glacial and
took place from Siberia, since the majority of the
species are still to be found in that country at the
present day (p. 57). He also draws particular attention
to a fact,&mdash;which I shall discuss more fully in the
next chapter,&mdash;namely, that the most characteristically
Arctic forms of Northern Europe, which also partly
occur in the Alps, are entirely absent from the
Caucasus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p><p>Adopting the glacial views of some of our leading
geologists, Petersen comes to the logical conclusion
that Central Europe could not have possessed
any butterflies during the height of the Glacial
period, but since all evidences seem to point to the
chief migration from Siberia having taken place after
the Glacial period, he concludes that they must have
survived the severe cold of that time in Central Asia.
He leaves us, however, to imagine under what possible
geographical conditions the climate in Europe could
be too severe for a lepidopterous fauna, while at the
same time Central Asia could maintain an abundant
one.</p>

<p>In a suggestive note on the origin of European
and North American Ants, Professor Emery states
(p. 399) that a great number of North American
ants are specifically identical with European ones;
whilst Dr. Hamilton tells us (p. 89), as an instance,
that specimens of the beetle <i>Loricera c&oelig;rulescens</i>
from Lake Superior and from Scotland do not seem
to vary to the extent of a hair on the antennæ.
He enumerates 487 species of <i>Coleoptera</i> as being
common to North America, Northern Asia, and
Europe, many of which no doubt have migrated by
the Americo-European land-connection.</p>

<p>Arctic Scandinavia or Lapland, according to Sir
Joseph Hooker, contains three-fourths of the entire
number of species of plants known from the whole
circumpolar area. His view, that the Greenland
flora is almost exclusively Lapponian,&mdash;having only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
an extremely slight admixture of American or
Asiatic types,&mdash;again points to a former more
intimate connection between North America and
Arctic Europe, and indeed he remarks (p. 252),
"It is inconceivable to me that so many Scandinavian
plants should, under existing conditions
of sea, land, and temperature, have not only found
their way to Greenland by migration across the
Atlantic, but should have stopped short on its
western coast and not crossed to America."</p>

<p>Hooker's view, that the Scandinavian flora is of
great antiquity, that, at the advent of the Glacial
period, it was everywhere driven southwards, and
that during the succeeding warm epoch the surviving
species returned north, has been adopted by
the great majority of naturalists.</p>

<p>The natural corollary of this theory is that there
must have been, between the beginning of the Glacial
period and the present time, either two independent
land-connections between the Polar Regions and
Northern Europe at different epochs to enable
animals and plants to travel southwards and once
more to regain their former northern home, or,
that during the whole of the Glacial period the
Polar Regions were uninterruptedly connected with
Northern Europe, until the fauna and flora had once
more reached their northern goal, after the Polar
lands had been desolated by the supposed rigours of
that period.</p>

<p>In following the history of the Arctic migration to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Europe, it is of great importance to determine the
nature and the time of duration of these land-connections.
The Greenland flora is a very instructive
one in helping us to understand many
of the problems connected with the origin of the
European plants and animals. To judge from the
remarks of Professor James Geikie and Mr. Clement
Reid, no flowering plants could have existed in
the British Islands during the height of the Glacial
period, and one would suppose that the cold in Greenland
at that time must have been far more intense
than in England. If no flowering plants could exist
in the latter country, then very surely none could in
Greenland, where the climate was of necessity by far
more rigorous. It will be a surprise, therefore, to
those who are acquainted only with Professor Geikie's
views of the nature of the Glacial period, that two of
the most eminent Swedish botanists, who have made
a special study of the flora of Greenland, have come
to the conclusion that a survival of flowering plants
has taken place in Greenland itself from pre-glacial
times. According to Professor Nathorst (p. 200),
only a few plants could have survived the Glacial
period in Greenland. The species now peculiar to
that country may perhaps, he thinks, be the remnants
of those which existed in pre-glacial times. Mr.
Warming, on the other hand, is of opinion that the
main mass of Greenland's present flora survived the
Glacial period there (p. 403), and that the remainder
was carried from Europe and North America by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
occasional means of distribution of the nature indicated
by Darwin.</p>

<p>Very similar views on the origin of the present
Polar flora are expressed by Colonel Feilden, who
says, "To my mind it seems indisputable that several
plants now confined to the Polar area must have
originated there and have outlived the period of
greatest ice-development in that region" (<i>b</i>, p. 50).
No land-connection at all need be supposed to have
existed in recent geological times, that is to say,
during the Glacial period or after, if Mr. Warming's
and Colonel Feilden's views be adopted. A pre-glacial
connection would be sufficient to explain the general
features of distribution. An admission is thus obtained
from these two independent authorities that
the climate during the Glacial period must have
been vastly less severe in the Polar Regions than
is generally conceded. I am of opinion that not
only the whole of the present flora, but also the
fauna of Greenland survived the Glacial period in
that country.</p>

<p>If we suppose that an extensive centre of origin
existed in the Polar area, or we may say in Greenland,
both animals and plants would have been able
to spread from it into Northern Europe and North
America by means of the land-connections which are
generally supposed to have existed in pliocene times,
that is to say, just before the commencement of the
Glacial period. There must have been at this time
a connection too between Scotland and Scandinavia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
which will be dealt with more fully presently. The
important point is to consider what light the Greenland
flora and fauna will throw upon the problem
of the continuity of the aforesaid land-connection
during the Glacial period. We have seen
that the Barren-ground Reindeer, a typically Polar
species, penetrated as far south as the Pyrenees, the
Arctic Hare went as far, while a number of other
species of Polar animals and also of plants occur
in the Alps. Of these it remains to be seen how
many have come direct by way of Northern Europe
or from the Polar Regions by way of Asia. At any
rate, as the origin of the Alpine animals and plants
will be discussed in another chapter, there is no need
to dwell on this subject at present.</p>

<p>From the nature of the distribution in Ireland of
Arctic plants and animals, which occur mostly on the
north and west coasts, it would seem that a stream of
migration entered from Scotland, and I have no doubt
that that same migration came into Scotland directly
from Scandinavia by a route over which now roll the
waves of the North Sea. There is, moreover, as I
already mentioned on p. <a href="#Page_94">94</a>, a very interesting so-called
American element in the north-western European
flora, that is to say, plants now found in North-west
Europe and North America without occurring in
Greenland or any of the islands which might have
formed the former highway between the Old World
and the New. These are probably some of the more
ancient Polar plants which have become extinct in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
the Arctic Regions and survive in isolated patches in
favourable localities. We find seven species of these
American plants in Ireland, almost entirely confined
to the north and west coasts. These are <i>Spiranthes
Romanzoviana</i>, <i>Sisyrinchium anceps</i>, <i>Naias flexilis</i>,
<i>Eriocaulon septangulare</i>, <i>Juncus tenuis</i>, and <i>Polygonum
sagittifolium</i>. To them must be added another plant
recently discovered by the Rev. Mr. Marshall in the
south of Ireland, namely <i>Sisyrinchium californicum</i>.
As I have mentioned in former writings, there are
three species of North American freshwater-sponges
in Ireland which have not hitherto been discovered
elsewhere in Europe or in Asia. These, namely
<i>Ephydatia crateriformis</i>, <i>Heteromeyenia Ryderi</i>, and
<i>Tubella pennsylvanica</i>, all occur in some of the lakes
near the western coast of Ireland.</p>

<p>There are in all groups of animals instances of species
which are confined to Europe and North America, while
unknown from the Asiatic continent, but none, as far
as is known, have such a very discontinuous range as
that of the animals and plants just referred to. In
some cases the species still occur in Greenland, and
in this way make it still clearer that their migration
in former times took place from one continent to
the other by way of that country. As an interesting
instance of such distribution may be mentioned the
Common Stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), which
is found in Greenland, North America, and Europe,
but is quite absent from Asia. Then again, the Nine-spined
Stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus pungitius</i>) is confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
to Western Europe and North America, though an
allied species, <i>Gasterosteus sinensis</i>, lives in China and
has probably penetrated there from the New World
across the old Behring Straits land-connection.</p>

<p>The Coleoptera <i>Diachila arctica</i>, <i>Elaphrus lapponicus</i>,
and <i>Blethisa multipunctata</i> are good instances of
species which have come to us from North America
by way of Greenland. I have already referred to
the Lepidoptera, but might add that eleven species
of <i>Anarta</i> occur in Scandinavia, eight of which
reappear again in Labrador, none of them, however,
being met with in Siberia. Then again, take the interesting
Crustacean <i>Lepidurus (Apus) glacialis</i>. It
is found in Greenland, Spitsbergen, Lapland, and
Norway; and formerly, as we know from fossil
evidence, it ranged into Scotland. Another Phyllopod,
viz., <i>Branchinecta paludosa</i>, inhabits Greenland,
Lapland, and Norway. Mr. Kennard suggests that
the freshwater Snail <i>Planorbis glaber</i> might also
belong to the same migration. And there are no
doubt large numbers of others.</p>

<p>Professor Emery mentions that Northern Europe
possesses one peculiar genus of Ant, viz., <i>Anergates</i>.
This is closely allied to <i>Epoccus</i>, another genus confined
to North America. It seems probable, therefore,
that both of these have sprung from an Arctic
genus which sent two branches southward into the
two continents without there being any migration
through Asia.</p>

<p>The general range of the Arctic plants and animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
gives no reason to suppose that the Greenland fauna
and flora of the present day were exterminated by the
Glacial period and then reintroduced into that country.
Nor have we any evidence that such a fauna and flora
migrated across the British Islands northward. The
Greenland animals and plants too are altogether much
more like the Lapland ones than those of Scotland.
It will also become evident to the reader of this work
that no very extensive migrations could have taken
place during the post-glacial period, and that almost
everything points to a survival of both fauna and
flora in northern latitudes throughout the Glacial
period.</p>

<p>If we take into consideration the palæontological
evidence of the two races of Reindeer in Europe, one of
which came to us from the north, and that the Arctic
Hare and one of the races of the Stoat entered our
continent from the same direction&mdash;when we, moreover,
carefully review the numerous other instances
quoted of plants and animals which could only have
reached us from the north, the irresistible conclusion is
forced upon us that a land-connection existed at no
very distant period between Northern Europe and the
Arctic Regions of North America. This is not a new
hypothesis. Many geologists are of opinion that a
land-passage did exist within comparatively recent
times, uniting Europe, Greenland, and North America.
But the position of this old land-bridge, as I have
mentioned, has been generally placed somewhat
farther south than I should feel inclined to put it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>The fact that very extensive glaciers formerly
covered the mountains of Scandinavia on the eastern
side, whilst they scarcely reached the sea on the west
(Feilden, <i>a</i>, p. 721), seems to favour the view of a
warm current having washed the western shores. As
I shall attempt to show later on (p. <a href="#Page_179">179</a>), the Arctic
Ocean extended across Northern Russia at that time
from the White Sea to the Baltic&mdash;that is to say, to
the eastern shores of Scandinavia, which country was
then joined to the north of Scotland. The predisposing
agents to a copious snowfall existed in
Scandinavia, viz., an excessive evaporation of the
warm Atlantic waters and unusual precipitation in
the form of snow owing to the cold given off by
the Arctic waters on the east side of the mountains.
It is therefore probable that the land-connection
which united Europe and North America was farther
north than has been supposed.</p>

<p>If we sail straight across from Northern Scandinavia
to Greenland, we traverse an exceedingly deep marine
basin; but if we examine the sub-marine bank which
runs all along the coast of the former country from
south to north, we find that it does not end when the
extreme north of the land is reached. The bank
extends much farther north, and is continued as far
as Spitsbergen. As I have said before, the latter,
as well as Bear Island, must be looked upon as the
remains of a large mass of sunken land&mdash;the ancient
Scandinavia stretching far into the Arctic Circle. Professor
Nathorst speaks of Spitsbergen as a northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
continuation of Europe, not only geographically, but
also botanically and geologically. However, this
northern land must have stretched even farther&mdash;not
perhaps farther north, but farther west. Here lay the
old land-connection between Scandinavia, Greenland,
and North America (<a href="#Figure13">Fig. 13</a>). One of the highest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
authorities on the geographical distribution of plants,
Professor Engler, maintains that the arguments in
favour of this Arctic connection of America with
Europe are more weighty than those for a land-bridge
between Greenland, Iceland, the Faroes, and Great
Britain. Moreover, he is of opinion that a certain
number of species of plants belonging to the Alpine
flora of Arctic Siberia have travelled from Scandinavia
<i>viâ</i> Greenland and North America to Eastern Asia,
and not direct from Scandinavia to Siberia (p. 143).</p>

shaded parts indicate the areas covered by water, and the white
portions what was land at the time.</p>

<p>That this ancient Arctic land-connection existed
almost throughout the Glacial period appears to me
probable. It has often been suggested that such a
land-barrier was one of the principal causes of the
production of the glacial phenomena in Europe,
and as such it must have existed intact certainly
during the earlier stages of the Glacial period.
The barrier must then have gradually subsided in
one or two places; and once a breach was formed,
the complete union between the Atlantic and
the Arctic Oceans could not have been long
delayed.</p>

<p>The terrestrial fauna and flora, as we have seen,
lend strong support to the view of the former
connection between Scandinavia and Greenland, but
many other facts point in the same direction. It was
Edward Forbes who first drew attention to the presence
of a number of species of littoral molluscs on
the coast of Finmark which also occur on the coast of
Greenland, and he expressed the firm conviction that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
they indicated by their existence on both sides of the
Atlantic some ancient continuity of the coast-line.
He held that the line of migration of these mollusca
was probably from west to east, and that it must
have taken place during physical conditions entirely
different from those prevailing at present. If Forbes's
view is correct, a current must have existed from the
north coast of North America along the northern
shore of the ancient land which stretched east as
far as Europe. We have also some palæontological
evidence bearing on the existence of such a current
(p. <a href="#Page_173">173</a>).</p>

<p>As we shall learn presently, the early stages of
the Glacial period were accompanied by a marine
transgression over Northern Russia and Germany&mdash;an
overflow, as it were, of the waters of the Arctic
Ocean covering a great part of Northern Europe,
with the exception of Norway. One continuous
ocean ultimately extended from the east coast
of England across Holland, Northern Germany, and
Russia to the White Sea (<a href="#Figure12">Fig. 12</a>, p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>). The
south of England being at that time joined to
France, and Scotland to Scandinavia, there was no
direct communication between this large North
European Sea and the Atlantic. The glaciers
which took their origin in the Scandinavian Mountains
discharged icebergs into this sea, and many of
them no doubt were stranded on the east coast of
England. The boulders of Scandinavian origin which
have been discovered in recent geological deposits on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
that coast have generally been traced to the action of
land-ice, but the supposition that they have been
carried by icebergs&mdash;the older theory&mdash;appears to
me the more probable one. Such boulders begin
to make their first appearance in the Red Crag, a
deposit which is now looked upon as belonging to
the newer pliocene series. But whether we call it
pliocene or pleistocene really matters little. The
important fact is, that glacial phenomena, consisting
of the appearance of boulders foreign to the country
together with an invasion of Arctic shells, are now
ushered in upon a coast which shortly before teemed
with the southern life of a Mediterranean character.
Among the new arrivals in these English crags there
are no less than eighteen species of North American
marine mollusca. Since the German Ocean had then
no direct communication with the Atlantic, these
mollusca could only have come from the White
Sea, and Forbes's <i>Arctic current</i> would offer an
explanation of the manner in which they were
enabled to migrate there from their original
home.</p>

<p>It might be urged that we have no grounds
for the supposition that the German Ocean was
practically a closed basin; and that these American
species probably inhabited at that time the whole of
the North Atlantic Ocean. But if such had been the
case, we ought to have evidence of the occurrence of
some of these species in the newer Tertiary deposits
along the west coasts of the British Islands. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
beds exist; there is, however, not a trace in any
of them of any American mollusca. In examining
the marine deposits of St. Erth, on the coast of
Cornwall, which are believed to be of about the same
age as the newer crags, Messrs. Kendall and Bell
were much struck by the absence of the species
characteristic of the latter. The St. Erth fauna led
them to believe that the Arctic Ocean could not
then have opened into the Atlantic, but that a land-communication
had existed between Europe and
North America, so as to form a barrier of separation
between the two oceans. This again perfectly harmonises
with the views I have expressed, and
supports them.</p>

<p>Let us now look a little more closely at the
history and the fauna of the Baltic and the adjoining
lakes, in order to gain additional information as to the
geographical changes which have had such lasting
influence on the peninsula of Scandinavia. The
Baltic is a shallow sea covering an area of 184,496
square miles, and its waters are decidedly brackish.
The fauna is a poor one, being too salt for the purely
freshwater species and not salt enough for the typical
marine forms. The absence of some animals which
we should expect to find there is one of the remarkable
features about the Baltic, but, on the other hand,
some species occur which are altogether strangers to
the fauna. And these, moreover, are confined to the
extreme northern end of the sea. I need only refer
to the Arctic Seal (<i>Phoca annelata</i>), which is confined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
to the Gulf of Bothnia, and to the four-horned sting-fish
(<i>Cottus quadricornis</i>, <a href="#Figure14">Fig. 14</a>, p. <a href="#Page_178">178</a>), neither of
which occur on the west coast of Scandinavia. But
there are others which point in an equally unmistakable
manner to the former existence of a marine connection
between the Baltic and the southward prolongation of
the Arctic Ocean&mdash;known as the White Sea. It is
generally admitted now that such a union between
these two seas, viz., the Baltic and the White Sea,
occurred in recent geological times, but opinions
differ as to the duration of this connection. I
adhere to the view expressed by Murchison and
others, that the boulder-clay is a marine deposit. I
am also convinced that the Arctic Ocean, as I have
already mentioned, transgressed over the lowlands
of Northern Russia at about the time when the
newer crags were being deposited on the east coast
of England; that the same large sea also covered
Northern Germany, Denmark, Holland, and the lowlands
of Sweden, and laid down the lower continental
boulder-clay which is spread over such vast tracts of
land in those countries. I shall have occasion to refer
to this again more fully in the next chapter; meanwhile,
it should be remembered that this stage was
followed by a partial retreat of the northern sea,
though Scandinavia did not become joined to the
Continent. The date of this retreat of the sea, represented
in <a href="#Figure13">Fig. 13</a>, corresponds probably to what is
known as the inter-glacial phase of the Glacial period,
and I think it must have been during this time that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
the Forest-Bed on the coast of Norfolk was laid
down.<a name="FNanchor_2_7" id="FNanchor_2_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_7" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>None of the Siberian mammals apparently entered
Scandinavia at the time when they invaded Central
Europe and penetrated as far west as England and
Western France. Nor did the great Oriental mammals,
like the Mammoth and others, reach Scandinavia; and
Professor Pohlig argued, on the strength of these
facts, that the latter country was either for a
very short time only free from ice, or that it had
defective land-communication with the Continent
during inter-glacial times. This seems to me
scarcely to explain the facts of distribution and
account satisfactorily for the absentees. Nor does it,
of course, harmonise with the views that I have
announced above. Professor Engler's remark (p. 131),
that Scandinavia probably projected above the glacial
sea as an island, is more in accordance with these
views, though the term island is scarcely applicable
to that country, since it was always, as I said, indirectly
joined to the Continent (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Figure13">Fig. 13</a>, p. <a href="#Page_170">170</a>).
The fauna of Scandinavia, both fossil and recent, points
to a direct isolation of that country from the continent
of Europe during a considerable period.</p>

<p>Another proof that Northern Russia and the lowlands
of Sweden were covered by the sea comes to us
from a study of the fauna of the relict lakes&mdash;the
"Reliktenseen" of Leuckart. This name was first
applied by Leuckart to lakes containing marine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
organisms, which are supposed to have been
flooded by, or to have been in close communication
with the sea at some former period, like the lakes
Ladoga and Onega in Russia. His views have been
worked out subsequently in greater detail by Lovén
and O. Peschel, who gave them their strong adherence.
Many leading zoologists, such as Professor Sars and
others, have since adopted them, and though discredited
by Professor Credner, the theory still
offers the best explanation for the origin of marine
animals in freshwater lakes.</p>

<p>Professor Credner's contention, that marine mollusca
are always absent from these relict lakes, seems at first
sight a stumbling-block to the theory. But the explanation
is really simple enough. It is to Dr. Sollas
that we owe a very ingenious explanation of the origin
of freshwater faunas. He showed that all freshwater
organisms in their early stages of development are provided
either with some process enabling them to attach
themselves to a foreign object, or that they pass this
period within the body of the parent. This is a
provision of nature to prevent freshwater organisms
from being floated out to sea, where they would
perish, until they reach maturity and can cope with
floods and currents. Had Professor Credner been
aware of Dr. Sollas's views, no doubt he would have
modified his criticisms, for, as most marine mollusca
have free-swimming larvæ, they would have little
chance of becoming permanent residents of lakes.
During their larval stage, marine molluscs are quite a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
prey to the currents of the sea. They have practically
no swimming organs, and only move by lashing to and
fro the tender cilia with which they are provided.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14</span>&mdash;The Four-horned Sting-fish (<i>Cottus quadricornis</i>), reduced
from Professor Smitt's figure in the <i>Fishes of Scandinavia</i>.</p>

<p>This disposes, therefore, of Professor Credner's
main criticisms. As for the fauna of the relict
lakes, we are now only concerned with those of
Northern Russia, Finland, and Sweden. In the
lakes Wetter and Wener in the latter country
occurs the four-horned sting-fish (<i>Cottus quadricornis</i>,
<a href="#Figure14">Fig. 14</a>), which, as we have learned, also inhabits the
northern part of the Baltic, and, as was suggested,
migrated there at a time when the latter was
connected with the White Sea. The principal food
of this little fish consists in a marine Crustacean
called <i>Idotea entomon</i>, an animal allied to our
common woodlouse. This is a typical marine
species, but it occurs also in the relict lakes of
the countries mentioned above, as well as in the
Baltic and the Caspian. Perhaps the best known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
form with a similar range is the Schizopod crustacean
<i>Mysis relicta</i><a name="FNanchor_3_8" id="FNanchor_3_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_8" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> (<a href="#Figure15">Fig. 15</a>), which is clearly a descendant
of the Arctic marine <i>Mysis oculata</i>, of which
it was formerly considered a mere variety. The two
Amphipods <i>Gammaracanthus relictus</i> and <i>Pontoporeia
affinis</i> and the Copepod <i>Limnocalanus macrurus</i>, are
three additional well-known Arctic crustaceans whose
range differs but little from those above-mentioned.<a name="FNanchor_4_9" id="FNanchor_4_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_9" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15</span>&mdash;Mysis relicta, a small shrimp-like Crustacean, after Sars

<p>These facts all go to prove that the sea formerly
covered the lowlands of Sweden, Finland, and
Northern Russia. The fauna of Scandinavia, as
we have seen, indicates that during the greater part
of the Glacial period the country was not directly
connected with continental Europe as it is now. It
seems that the barrier of separation probably consisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>of a broad expanse of ocean on which floated
numerous icebergs, which originated from the Scandinavian
glaciers as they reached the sea. This was
a cold sea, whilst Western Scandinavia was washed
by the Gulf Stream (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Figure12">Fig. 12</a>, p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>). We
might look upon the boulder-clay which covers such
vast tracts of country in Northern Germany, Russia,
and Holland as deposits formed by this sea rather
than the ground-moraine of a huge Scandinavian
glacier. I shall refer to this subject again in the
next chapter; meanwhile it may be remembered
that the boulder-clay of Northern Europe exactly
resembles in all important particulars the similar
accumulations met with in the British Islands.
They resemble one another also in the occasional
occurrence of sea-shells, the frequent appearance of
bedded deposits, and the often inexplicable course
taken by boulders from their source of origin. There
occurs often a singular mixture and an apparent
crossing of the paths of boulders in the boulder-clay.
Professor Bonney remarks (p. 280) that these
are less difficult to explain on the hypothesis of
distribution by floating ice than on that of transport
by land-ice, because, in the former case, though the
drift of winds and currents would be generally in one
direction, both might be varied at particular seasons.
So far as concerns the distribution and thickness of
the glacial deposits, he says there is not much
to choose between either hypothesis; but on that
of land-ice it is extremely difficult to explain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
intercalation of perfectly stratified sands and gravels
and of boulder-clay, as well as the not infrequent
signs of bedding in the latter. Two divisions are
generally recognisable in the continental boulder-clay&mdash;a
lower and an upper. An inter-glacial phase
characterised by a less severe climate is assumed
to have intervened between the deposition of the
two. In Russia no such division can as a rule be
made out, and sea-shells are either entirely absent or
extremely scarce. It has been pointed out by Professor
J. Geikie that the erratics&mdash;a name applied to
boulders in boulder-clay&mdash;in the upper division have
travelled in a different direction from those contained
in the lower. Taking for granted that the boulder-clay
is a marine deposit, this phenomenon seems
to indicate that the current which prevailed during
the early part of the Glacial period in this North
European ocean was different from the prevailing
current during the latter part. I have attempted
to explain this circumstance by the supposition
that during the early part of the Glacial period
the Northern Sea had a connection with the Ponto-Caspian
Sea&mdash;a sea formed by the junction of the
Black Sea and the Caspian (<a href="#Figure12">Fig. 12</a>, p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>). There
is geological evidence, as will be explained in the
following chapter, that the area of these two seas was
considerably larger in glacial times than it is now,
and that they were joined across the valley of the
Manytch. After the inter-glacial phase of the Glacial
period, the North European Ocean became connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
with the Atlantic Ocean across the north of England
(<a href="#Figure06">Fig. 6</a>, p. <a href="#Page_126">126</a>), the junction between the former
and the Ponto-Caspian having meanwhile become
dry land (<a href="#Figure13">Fig. 13</a>, p. <a href="#Page_170">170</a>). A fresh current, now
flowing westward, was set up in the North European
Ocean, which accounts for the fact just cited
that the erratics in the upper continental boulder-clay
have travelled in a different direction from
those in the lower. The boulder-clay laid down by
the sea on the midland and northern counties of
England, just as was the case with the similar deposit
on the Continent, is generally accredited to the
action of land-ice. It is by most geologists looked
upon as the ground-moraine, partly of the huge
Scandinavian glacier which is supposed to have
impinged upon the English coast, partly of local
British glaciers.</p>

<p>But renewed geological investigations on this point
throw doubts upon these theories. Thus Mr. Harmer
remarks in a recent contribution to glacial literature
(p. 775), that "it is difficult to see how the Baltic
glacier could have reached East Anglia, though ice-floes
with Scandinavian boulders might easily have
done so, while had the Norwegian ice filled the North
Sea and overflowed the county of Norfolk, some evidence
of its presence ought to be found in the glacial
beds of Holland."</p>

<p>All the phenomena of distribution of the British
fauna and flora are, as we have seen, much more easily
explained by the supposition of a damp, temperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
climate, such as might have been produced by the
proximity of a cold sea on one side and of a warm
one at the other, than by invoking an arctic climate
with enormous glaciers. Most of the living animals
and plants would have been exterminated under the
latter conditions. Palæontological evidence in Great
Britain clearly indicates that southern species migrated
first to these islands, that Arctic species were then
driven south from their native lands,&mdash;probably owing
insufficient food-supply and climatic changes in
the north,&mdash;that finally eastern species invaded the
country&mdash;all this without the annual temperature
of Europe being apparently much affected. For we
find in the British pleistocene deposits&mdash;and Mr.
Lydekker draws particular attention to this remarkable
fact&mdash;a curious intermingling of southern and
northern mammals, which undoubtedly lived side by
side. Everybody knows that northern and Arctic
species can live perfectly well in a temperate climate,
but that it is almost impossible to acclimatise
southern animals in an Arctic or even temperate
one. We have in this circumstance almost a proof,
therefore, that the climate cannot have been very cold.
Though a cold sea bathed the shores of Eastern
England, and even eventually invaded a portion of
Northern England, the warm ocean on the west
must have effectually prevented any great lowering
of temperature.</p>

<p>At the time when the North European Sea flooded
a portion of England, Scandinavia was still connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
with Scotland, and the latter with Ireland (<a href="#Figure06">Fig. 6</a>,
p. <a href="#Page_126">126</a>). There is no doubt that the food-supply in the
Arctic Regions was decreasing with an increase of
snowfall and with the gradual lowering of the land,
which reduced also the habitable area. Arctic species
therefore were driven south in search of fresh pastures.
But it need not be supposed that anything like a vast
destruction of the fauna of the Arctic Regions took
place. Only fewer mammals were able to find food
in a given space than heretofore. This southward
migration may have commenced, in the case of
plants and the invertebrates, at a much earlier time,&mdash;during
the Miocene or Pliocene Epochs,&mdash;but it
is doubtful whether the mammals and birds which
we find in our pleistocene and recent deposits
began to travel south much before the commencement
of the Glacial period. The beginning of the
Glacial period in England, I think, is indicated by
the deposition of the Red Crag, though the latter is
generally regarded as belonging to the pliocene
series. Much of the northward migration from
the British Islands of Lusitanian and other forms
had then ceased, but we have in Scandinavia, just
as in these islands, a southern relict fauna and flora,
plants and animals which had wandered across what
is now the German Ocean from Scotland to Scandinavia,
and have never become extinct in that
country to the present day. I need only mention
the Red Deer, the Badger, and Slugs of the genus
<i>Arion</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p><p>Professor Blytt directs attention to some such
southern relict species of plants now only found in the
extreme south-west of Scandinavia, such as <i>Asplenium
marinum</i>, <i>Hymenophyllum Wilsoni</i>, <i>Carex binervis</i>,
<i>Scilla verna</i>, <i>Erica cinerea</i>, <i>Conopodium denudatum</i>,
<i>Meum athamanticum</i>, and <i>Rosa involuta</i> (p. 28).</p>

<p>The Arctic fauna and flora in Scandinavia&mdash;that
is to say, the descendants of those species which
migrated direct from Greenland and Spitsbergen,
as we have seen, are numerous. They of course persisted
throughout the Glacial period in the country,
and are now in many localities being exterminated
partly by change of climate, partly by a keen competition
with more vigorous rivals which have come
to Scandinavia from the east. It is a curious circumstance,
as pointed out by Professor Blytt, that the
Arctic plants in the Botanic Gardens at Christiania
are able to stand almost any amount of sunshine,
but are very liable to be injured by the frost, and have
to be covered in the winter. A similar observation
has been made in the case of the Alpine plants at
Kew Gardens, which have to be wintered in frames,
though their homes are either in the high Alps&mdash;among
the everlasting snows&mdash;or in the intensely cold climate
of Greenland. Many of the Scandinavian plants exhibit
instances of discontinuous distribution, thus showing
their ancient origin; and there is altogether nothing
in the fauna and flora of that country which might
lead us to believe that these were exterminated
during the Glacial period and reintroduced subsequently.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>The climate during that period in Scandinavia
was probably more equable and moister,&mdash;with
a greater snowfall in winter and with less
sun to melt the snow during summer,&mdash;so that the
development of glaciers took more formidable dimensions,
chiefly on the east side. The lowlands of
Sweden were covered by the sea, whilst many of
the valleys were choked with great glaciers, which
cast off portions of ice as they reached the sea, just
as the Greenland and other northern glaciers do (<i>vide</i>
p. <a href="#Page_237">237</a>). A country which at the present day probably
somewhat resembles the former Scandinavia climatically
is Tierra del Fuego, in the extreme south of
South America. Though there is an abundant
snowfall, so that glaciers reach the sea in many
parts of the country, the flora has been described by
travellers as luxuriant; and it appears that the fauna
also is richer than might be expected from the cheerless
climate.</p>

<p>Towards the latter part of the Glacial period the
land-connection between Scandinavia, Spitsbergen,
and Greenland broke down, and the waters of the
Arctic and Atlantic Oceans joined. Whether it was
at this time or later that the other land-connection
between Scandinavia and Scotland collapsed is
difficult to determine; but it is certain, I think,
that Scotland was still united with Ireland even after
these two great land-bridges ceased to exist.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p><h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER IV.</h3>

<p>The fauna of the Arctic Regions is much poorer than that of the
other regions which are dealt with in this work. In some groups,
such as Reptiles and Amphibia, there are no representatives at all,
but no doubt a larger number of species existed there in earlier
Tertiary times. At least we have fossil evidence that during
the Miocene Epoch plants of many families flourished in Greenland
of which no vestige is now left in the Polar area. Climatic
conditions must therefore have changed, as in Europe. A
gradual refrigeration took place, owing probably to the slow
withdrawal of the current which supplied the Arctic Sea with
warmth. Greenland and Europe were then connected, and
the Arctic Ocean was separated from the Atlantic. This land-connection
is supposed to have lain far north between Scandinavia,
Spitsbergen, and Greenland, and must have persisted
until towards the end of the Glacial period.</p>

<p>As the temperature decreased and the land-area available in
the north diminished, the surplus population, consisting of
animals and plants, and possibly also of human beings, moved
southward. We have traces in Europe, and especially in the
British Islands, of a very early migration from the north in the
so-called American plants and in the freshwater sponges. The
geographical distribution of some of the Arctic species of mammals
is referred to in greater detail, to show how the relative
age of their entry into Europe can be determined. Two forms
of Reindeer, resembling the Barren-ground and Woodland
varieties, have been met with in European deposits, but only
the former occurs in Ireland and the south of France, whilst
eastward the other becomes more common, and finally is the
only one found. It is believed that the Barren-ground is the
older form as far as Europe is concerned, and that it came to
us with the Arctic migration, and that the other Reindeer
reached Europe much later from Siberia, when Ireland had
already become detached from England. The range of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Arctic Hare is equally instructive. It must have been a native
of Europe since early glacial or pre-glacial times&mdash;before the
common English Hare had made its appearance in Central
Europe. Along with other Arctic forms, it entered Northern
Europe directly from the Arctic Regions, by means of the former
land-connection which joined, as I remarked, Lapland with
Spitsbergen, Greenland, and North America. There need not
have been a post-glacial connection between Europe and
Greenland; the present flora of that country may have survived
the Glacial period in the Arctic Regions, as has been maintained
by some botanists and other authorities. Professor
Forbes argued from the occurrence of the same species of
shore mollusca on the coast of Finmark and Greenland that
these two countries were not long ago joined, so that a slow
migration from west to east along an ancient coast-line could
have taken place. That such a migration actually occurred is
further made probable, judging from the presence of American
mollusca in the Crag deposits on the east coast of England.
These came into the North Sea in the first place direct from the
Arctic Ocean at a time when the two oceans freely communicated
with one another across the lowlands of Northern Russia,
Northern Germany, and Holland. Arctic shells are also found
below the boulder-clay on the Baltic coast, and a free communication
such as indicated is generally held to have taken
place at no very distant date. The so-called "relict species"&mdash;marine
animals left in freshwater lakes in districts formerly
covered by this sea&mdash;lend some support to this view. But the
view that the continental boulder-clay is a marine deposit is not
now held except by a few, though I here bring it forward again,
as it seems to me to fit in so much better with the known facts
of distribution. The sea just referred to probably existed
throughout the greater part of the Glacial period; and icebergs,
which originated from the Scandinavian glaciers, would have
brought detritus and boulders to the lowlands. Scandinavia
was then connected with Scotland, and England with France.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />

THE SIBERIAN MIGRATION.</h2>


<p>In dealing with the British fauna in particular, I
have drawn attention to the fact that it is chiefly in
the south of England that we find fossil remains
of eastern species of mammals in recent geological
deposits. We can actually trace the remains of
these species and their course of migration across
part of the Continent towards Eastern Europe, and
as none of their bones have been discovered in the
southern or northern parts of our Continent, it must
be assumed that their home lay in Siberia, where
many still exist to the present day, and where
closely allied forms also are found. Some of these
Siberian migrants have remained in England and
on the Continent to the present day. Many have
become extinct. But the animals forming this
eastern migration did not all originate in Siberia,
though I have sometimes spoken of them collectively
as Siberian migrants. There must have been other
centres of dispersion of species in Europe. We know
that a very active centre of development&mdash;at any rate
for land-mollusca&mdash;lay in South-eastern Europe, either
in the Caucasus or in the Balkan peninsula, or more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
probably in both. The Alps no doubt produced a
number of species which have spread north and
south, and may in their wanderings have joined the
Siberian migrants in their western course, and thus
have reached the British Islands. Nevertheless, the
majority of the mammals belonging to the eastern
element of the British fauna (<i>vide</i> p. <a href="#Page_95">95</a>) have undoubtedly
originated in Siberia. The Polecat (<i>Mustela
putorius</i>) and the Harvest Mouse (<i>Mus minutus</i>),
for instance, are members of that eastern migration.
Both occur throughout Central Europe and a large
portion of Siberia, but are absent from the extreme
north and south of Europe and also from all the
Mediterranean Islands. A Siberian species, which
has never penetrated so far west as the British
Islands, nor even so far north as Scandinavia or
south to Italy, is what is known in Germany as the
"Hamster" (<i>Cricetus frumentarius</i>), a little Rodent
which spends the winter asleep in its burrows, and
surrounds itself with a great accumulation of food-material
carried there during autumn. The common
English Hare, which I formerly regarded as an
instance of a Siberian mammal, must now find a
place among the Oriental migrants. Its history is
very instructive, and I shall have an opportunity later
on to refer to it again. Meanwhile, it may be mentioned
that though this Hare inhabits Europe in two
varieties or races, one of which, <i>Lepus mediterraneus</i>,
is confined to Southern Europe, the latter owes
its origin to an earlier migration from Asia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p><p>When we come to consider the eastern birds, we
have to distinguish between resident species and
migratory ones. The Black-throated Thrush (<i>Turdus
atrigularis</i>), which has been twice obtained in the
British Islands, is a mere straggler to Europe, and
is not known to breed there at all. Better known
birds, perhaps, are the Golden Thrush (<i>Turdus varius</i>),
which has even occurred as far west as Ireland, the
Rock-Thrush (<i>Monticola saxatilis</i>) and the Scarlet
Grosbeak (<i>Carpodacus erythrinus</i>), which breed in
Eastern Europe, but are known only as occasional
visitors in the west.</p>

<p>To judge by their distribution, the Bullfinches
(<i>Pyrrhula</i>) are of Asiatic origin, for seven species out
of ten are confined to that continent. Our common
Bullfinch (<i>P. europæa</i>) probably came with the Oriental
migrants, or perhaps its ancestors did. But the larger
Northern or Russian Bullfinch (<i>P. major</i>) has no doubt
entered our Continent directly from the east. We have
in many groups similar instances of closely allied species
or varieties, one of which, originating at a somewhat
later stage than the other, took a different route of
migration from that followed by its near relative.</p>

<p>The Pine-Grosbeak (<i>Pinicola enucleator</i>) is only
known to British ornithologists as an exceedingly
rare visitor. Its real home lies in the northern parts
of Europe, Asia, and North America, and it is one
of the most typical of the Siberian migrants.</p>

<p>But there are a number of other species of birds,
which, though probably not of Siberian origin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
only migrated westward recently, and have either
not yet reached the British Islands, or which lead one
to suppose, from their British range, that they are
eastern forms.</p>

<p>Such, for instance, is the Nightingale (<i>Daulias
luscinia</i>), which is probably of Oriental origin, but
only visits England regularly in spring. There is no
authenticated record of its ever having migrated
either to Scotland or Ireland.</p>

<p>The Bearded Titmouse (<i>Panurus biarmicus</i>) is one
of the eastern birds still resident in England, though
unfortunately it seems to be on the verge of extinction.
It is unknown in Scotland and Ireland.
Another resident eastern species is the Nuthatch
(<i>Sitta cæsia</i>), but neither of these is probably of
Siberian origin.</p>

<p>The majority of the European Reptiles are probably
of eastern origin. Among our British species, the
Common Viper (<i>Pelias berus</i>), for example, is a
typically eastern form. It is almost unknown in
Southern Europe proper&mdash;that is to say, in Italy,
the Balkan peninsula, and the Mediterranean Islands,
but its range extends in the west as far as Spain, and
in the east right across the Asiatic continent to
Japan. It is well known that the Viper occurs in
Scotland, and that neither it nor any other snake is
found in Ireland. There is a legend, indeed, that
snakes did once exist in Ireland and were banished
from the island by St. Patrick, but unfortunately
we have no historical evidence that such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
interesting event actually took place. The Sand-Lizard
(<i>Lacerta agilis</i>), another British species, may
be looked upon as an eastern form. It is quite absent
from Italy, the Balkan peninsula, and the Mediterranean
Islands, but extends throughout Central
Europe to the east.</p>

<p>Among the species of eastern Reptiles which have
a mere local range in Europe might be mentioned
the two Lizards, <i>Phrynocephalus auritus</i> and <i>Agama
sanguinolenta</i>. They belong to the family <i>Iguanidæ</i>,
which includes some very large species. Both of
them are Asiatic forms, which have only just penetrated
across the eastern steppes into Europe, where
they inhabit the arid regions between the Caspian
and the River Don in Southern Russia.</p>

<p>The species of Mammals living in Europe at the
present day have, with few exceptions, migrated
to our continent from other parts of the world.
With regard to the Birds, it is possible that a
somewhat larger number proportionally may be
of European origin. Still, the great majority are,
I think, to be regarded as immigrants. The autochthones
are about equal to the immigrant reptiles,
but many of the European Amphibians and the
majority of the Fishes have probably originated on
our continent. Some of the European Amphibia&mdash;especially
among the tailless forms&mdash;appear to be
immigrants from Asia. Thus the distribution of
<i>Rana arvalis</i> in Europe is remarkably like that of
a Siberian migrant. This frog occurs in Siberia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
ranging southward as far as Persia and parts of
Asia Minor. Crossing the European border, we
find it in Russia, Upper Hungary, North and Central
Germany,&mdash;being rarer in the south,&mdash;Denmark, and
Scandinavia. According to Bedriaga, it crosses the
Rhine only in Alsace, but occurs no farther west. It
only just enters Holland. If we suppose the species
to have originated in Central Europe, we should
expect to find it in Switzerland, France, and perhaps
England. If it had its ancestral home in Eastern
Europe, we might expect it to occur on the Balkan
peninsula. It seems to me more probable, therefore,
that <i>Rana arvalis</i> came with the Siberian migration.
This need not cause surprise, as the genus <i>Rana</i> is
certainly not European. Out of about 110 species,
only four are peculiar to Europe, the rest are scattered
over all parts of the globe. Moreover, the fact that
these four species are confined to Southern Europe
would seem to indicate that the first species entered
from the south, and there either became modified or
spread over nearly the whole continent, as did, for
instance, <i>Rana esculenta</i> and <i>R. temporaria</i>. Neither
of these is by any means confined to Europe. <i>R.
esculenta</i> ranges right across the Asiatic continent to
Japan, and also enters North Africa, while the other
has a wide distribution in northern and temperate
Asia.</p>

<p>The various groups of Vertebrates are not dependent
on each other in their migrations. Mammals and Birds
extend their range with so much greater facility than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Reptiles and Amphibians, that the surplus population
of our neighbouring continents readily poured into
Europe when&mdash;owing to changes of climate perhaps&mdash;they
forsook their original homes.</p>

<p>We observe much the same differences of origin in
the various groups of European Invertebrates. The
Central European Molluscan fauna, remarks Dr.
Kobelt, had already developed from the pliocene&mdash;in
almost all its details, as regards formation of
species and distribution&mdash;when the Ice-Age commenced
(<i>b</i>, i. p. 162). Certain very interesting dislocations,
however, in the range of land mollusca can be
proved to have taken place about that time. Thus,
as Dr. Kobelt has pointed out, the genus <i>Zonites</i>,
which is now almost confined to the south-east of
Europe, occurs in inter-glacial deposits in the valley
of the Neckar, and even as far west as the Seine. If
we might judge from this single instance, a molluscan
migration from the east to the west seems to have
occurred either in early or pre-glacial times. That
<i>Helix pomatia</i> has migrated only comparatively
recently from the East to Western Europe is
rendered probable by its general range in northern
and western Europe, but I cannot agree with Dr.
Kobelt in the belief that <i>Helix aspersa</i> is of an
equally recent origin in the North. No matter
whether it has been found fossil or no, its range in
the British Islands points to its having penetrated to
Ireland when the latter was still connected with the
Continent by way of England. Its migration from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
the Mediterranean dates therefore from early pleistocene
or late pliocene times.</p>

<p>In referring to the sixty-five species of Land and
Freshwater Mollusca which have been described from
the continental "Loess," Dr. Kobelt states (p. 166)
that this fauna has certainly not a steppe-character.
It does not therefore strengthen Professor Nehring's
view that Europe during the deposition of the loess
had a climate comparable to that of the Siberian
steppes. The Glacial period had hardly any effect
on the molluscan fauna of Europe. Dr. Kobelt
believes in a certain movement of that fauna from
the least favourable areas, with a subsequent
re-immigration; but even that could not have
taken place on a large scale. Nothing like a
destruction of the fauna occurred, as far as we
know from fossil evidence.</p>

<p>Not a single species of land or freshwater mollusc
can be quoted as having migrated to Europe from
Siberia in recent geological times. The molluscan
fauna of the latter country is so closely connected
with that of Europe, that it is quite impossible to
elevate it to the rank of a sub-region of the Holarctic
Region. Dr. Kobelt insists that Siberia cannot even
claim to be placed into a distinct province. According
to the same authority, we find no species in the
whole Siberian molluscan fauna which we might
regard as having immigrated since the close of the
Glacial period. Even to attempt the location of
the original homes of many of the species which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Siberia has in common with Europe, seems hopeless.
Such forms as <i>Arion hortensis</i>, which has been
obtained in Siberia, and which, as we have seen, must
have originated in Western Europe, migrated in
pliocene or miocene times, possibly along the
shores of the Mediterranean and across Asia Minor.
We have evidence, therefore, of an eastward migration
among the land and freshwater mollusca in later
Tertiary times, but not of a westward one from
Siberia.</p>

<p>A very different view is presented to us by the
coleopterous fauna of Europe. Many of our European
Beetles are Siberian migrants. Let us take,
for instance, the Tiger Beetles (<i>Cicindelidæ</i>). There
are over forty species of the genus <i>Cicindela</i> in
Europe, five of which reach the British Islands.
This seems a large number; but there are altogether
no less than 600 species of the genus scattered over
the greater part of the world, many of them being
Asiatic. The genus is certainly not of European
origin, for not only are most of the European species
confined to the Caucasus and the south-east generally,
but no <i>Cicindelidæ</i> whatsoever occur, for example, in
Madeira or the Canaries, where we should expect
some to have persisted if the genus had originated
on our continent. Moreover, of the five tribes into
which the large family of <i>Cicindelidæ</i> can be sub-divided,
only two range to Europe, and one of
them is represented by only a single species on our
continent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p><p>Some of the <i>Cicindelas</i> may have come with the
Oriental migration. I think this was the case with
the only Irish species of the genus, <i>C. campestris</i>. It
occurs all over continental Europe and Northern Asia,
and varieties of the species are known from Corsica,
Sicily, Crete, the Cyclades, Sardinia, Asia Minor,
Greece, and Spain. Five species of <i>Cicindela</i>, as I
said, are known from England, of which <i>C. silvatica</i>
and <i>C. maritima</i> are certainly Siberian migrants, and
perhaps <i>C. hybrida</i> too. Neither of the two first
species is found in Southern Europe or in Spain,
where we should expect them to occur had they
originated on our continent. <i>C. silvatica</i> and
<i>maritima</i> have no doubt entered Europe from
Siberia in recent geological times, probably soon
after a way was opened up across the Tchornosjem
district of Southern Russia&mdash;that is to say, in
inter-glacial times. The former spread along the
Central European plain as far west as the south-east
of England when Great Britain still formed part of
France. <i>C. maritima</i>, which preferred the proximity
of the sea, migrated along the shores of the Caspian
and then across Russia to the shores of the Baltic
and North Sea, and has penetrated a little farther
north and west in England than its near relative.
<i>C. litterata</i> has a very similar distribution and origin,
but instead of wandering so far west as the British
Islands, it seems to have preferred extending its
range southward, and has just reached Northern
Italy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p><p>The closely allied Ground-beetles (<i>Carabidæ</i>) furnish
us with equally interesting and instructive proofs of a
migration from Asia. Over 300 species of <i>Carabus</i>
are known to science. The number of species
inhabiting Asia and Europe are about equal. But
the genus does not extend its range to Southern
Asia or to South America or Australia. Very
few species enter Africa, and only nine North
America, of which three also occur in Siberia. The
genus is unknown in Madeira, and only represented
by three species in the Canary Islands. To judge
from its distribution, it has probably originated in
Western Asia. Probably some <i>Carabi</i> of European
origin have spread into Asia, but the Asiatic&mdash;or
we might say the Siberian&mdash;origin and subsequent
migration westward of a number of well-known forms
appears to me evident. Such forms as <i>C. clathratus</i>,
<i>C. granulatus</i>, and <i>C. cancellatus</i> are no doubt of
European origin, and have only in recent geological
times extended their range across Northern Asia,
whilst <i>C. marginalis</i>, coming from Siberia, can hardly
be said to have invaded Europe, since it has never
been met with farther west than the eastern provinces
of Prussia.</p>

<p>Among the <i>Carabidæ</i> there are altogether very
many examples pointing to a migration from Asia to
Europe, but I do not wish here to give a list of all
such cases, and only refer to a few of the more
remarkable ones. One of the European species of
Demetrias (<i>D. unipunctatus</i>), known to English entomologists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>as a south-eastern form, seems to have
arrived with the Siberian migration, whilst the closely
allied <i>D. atricapillus</i>, which has been able to reach
Ireland, has a wider range and came earlier with the
Orientals.</p>

<p>Messrs. Speyer state (p. 68) that almost all those
species of Central European Butterflies whose
northern limit is deflected southward as we approach
the west coast of Europe, inhabit also the Volga
country and the adjoining parts of Asia. Many of
them are much commoner there than in Central
Europe, and it appears probable to the authors of
the <i>Geographical Distribution of Butterflies</i> that
these species came from the east. Asia and Central
Europe have, according to Messrs. Speyer, no fewer
than 156 species in common. Mr. Petersen estimates
that no less than 91 per cent. of the Arctic-European
Butterflies also occur in Siberia. He
made a special study of the Arctic <i>Macro-lepidoptera</i>,
and came to the conclusion that Central
Asia, not having been glaciated in the Ice-Age,
offered a possibility of existence to both animals
and plants. Here, he thinks, was the principal centre
to which Europe owed its re-population in post-glacial
times. Mr. Petersen is of opinion (p. 40) that the
Arctic-European <i>Lepidoptera</i> are composed of two
elements&mdash;the pliocene relics which persisted in
Europe during the Glacial period, and the new
immigrants from Siberia.</p>

<p>No doubt Siberia supplied Europe with a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
of species of Butterflies and Moths in recent geological
times, but we need not necessarily suppose
that these arrived only after the Glacial period. Even
the most extreme glacialists admit that large areas
on our continent were free from ice at the height of
the Ice-Age, Siberia had therefore no particular
advantage over Europe in giving an asylum to
Butterflies and Moths which were escaping from the
rigours of a supposed arctic climate. But we have
already learned (p. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>) that the climate during the
Glacial period probably differed but little from that
which we enjoy at the present day, and we may
assume, therefore, that the <i>Lepidoptera</i> of Siberia
migrated during that time or even earlier to
Europe.</p>

<p>Let us for a moment reconsider some instances of
mammalian migration from Siberia, with a view to
studying more closely the nature of these great
events. I mentioned the fact that some of the
Siberian migrants have remained in England, that
more have settled down permanently on our continent,
but that many others have either become
entirely extinct or do not live any longer in
Europe.</p>

<p>Of the mammals which made their appearance in
Great Britain in recent geological times, <i>i.e.</i>, during
and since the deposition of the Forest-Bed for example,
the following species probably came direct from
Siberia across the plains of Europe, as already mentioned
(p. <a href="#Page_95">95</a>):&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p>Of the arrival of many of these in Europe we have
geological proof, as they have left their bones in
recent pleistocene deposits, and are unknown from
older European strata. The remote ancestors of
others, such as <i>Sorex</i> and <i>Lagomys</i>, no doubt lived in
Europe, but the recent species probably had their
original homes in Asia. It is evident that in recent
geological times there existed no active centre of
origin for mammals in Europe, and that our continent
was largely dependent on the neighbouring one for
the supply of its mammalian fauna. A shifting of the
centre of development from Europe to Asia appears
to have taken place occasionally, as already mentioned
(p. <a href="#Page_45">45</a>). Mr. Lydekker has drawn attention
to the fact that though the remote ancestors of the
<i>Elephantidæ</i> resided in Europe, neither the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
continent nor North America was the home of the
direct ancestor of any of the true Elephants.
Similarly, though we have had our <i>Sorex</i> in Europe
from the Upper Eocene and <i>Lagomys</i> from the
Middle Miocene, the geographical distribution of
<i>Sorex vulgaris</i> and <i>Lagomys pusillus</i> does not support
the view that they are of European origin and have
migrated to Asia. Their absence from most of
the European islands indicates either an extremely
recent origin or a recent immigration from Asia,
and the latter view seems to me much the more
probable.</p>

<p>No less than twenty-six species of the Siberian
mammals penetrated as far west as the British Islands,
and nine of these still inhabit Great Britain. Some
of the remaining seventeen species probably lived only
for a very short time in England, and the rest
gradually became extinct one by one. This process
of extinction of the aliens still continues. The Beaver
(<i>Castor fiber</i>) has died out within recent historic times.
We possess legends and uncertain historic records
pointing to the existence of the Reindeer in Scotland
as recently as about seven centuries ago. But much
the same state of things has happened on the Continent.
The Glutton (<i>Gulo luscus</i>), which still lived
in Northern Germany last century, has now entirely
vanished from that country, as also the Reindeer.
The Lemmings have found an asylum in Scandinavia.
The Musk-Ox (<i>Ovibos moschatus</i>) has disappeared
not only from Europe but also from Asia, and is now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
confined to Arctic America and Greenland. The
Horse no longer occurs in Europe in the wild state,
and the Saiga Antelope (<i>Saiga tartarica</i>) has retreated
to the Steppes of Eastern Europe and Western
Siberia.</p>

<p>As we proceed more and more eastward across
Central Europe, we find that a larger and larger
percentage of the Siberian migrants have adopted
the new country as their permanent home, though in
France and Germany, as well as in Austria, we have
evidence that a great number of Siberian species, which
formerly lived there, have either become entirely
extinct, or have retreated towards the land of their
origin. There is a prevalent belief that these migrants
have taken refuge on the higher European mountain
ranges, but this idea is altogether erroneous, as will
be shown in the chapter dealing with the origin of the
Alpine fauna.</p>

<p>One of the Jerboas (<i>Alactaga jaculus</i>) occurs fossil
as far west as Western Germany, but it is now confined
to Russia and Western Siberia. The Bobak
marmot (<i>Arctomys bobak</i>), which has a similar range
now, probably inhabited France in former times.
A Siberian species which has retreated but little is
the Hamster (<i>Cricetus vulgaris</i>). Its fossil remains
have been found in Central France, but it does not
now occur west of the Vosges Mountains.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, as if a wave of migration had
swept over Central Europe from east to west, that
those species which were able to adapt themselves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the new surroundings had remained, and as if the rest
had died out or were gradually retreating to the
east.</p>

<p>Ornithologists are well acquainted with the fact
that in some years there is an unusually large exodus
from Eastern Europe and Siberia of birds; and that
species like the Waxwing (<i>Ampelis garrulus</i>) then
appear in great numbers. But the appearance of this
bird in Western Europe is not looked upon as so
remarkable as that of Pallas's Sandgrouse (<i>Syrrhaptes
paradoxus</i>, <a href="#Figure03">Fig. 3</a>, p. <a href="#Page_42">42</a>), a typical inhabitant and resident
of the Arctic Steppes. The last great irruption
took place in 1888, and many birds reached even the
extreme west of Ireland in May and June of that
year. A few weeks before, it had been announced to
the German papers that large flocks of this peculiar
pigeon-like bird had arrived in the eastern provinces;
and though the vast majority vanished as quickly as
they had come, a certain number remained for a year
or so in the newly visited countries, and some even
bred in England.</p>

<p>Twenty-five years before, in 1863, a similar migration
had occurred, though not perhaps on quite such
a vast scale, and a few small flocks had made their
appearance in Western Europe on several occasions
between these dates.</p>

<p>It may not be generally known that no other bird
has been honoured by our Government in a like
manner, for it is the only animal for whose protection
a separate Act of Parliament has been passed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
In spite of this unusual precaution, the species has
not survived to add another member to the resident
British fauna. The wave of migration from the east
has come and vanished again just like so many others
with which history is familiar.</p>

<p>These migrations from the east occurring at the
present day give us some idea of those of which we
have fossil evidence, and which all had their origin
in Central and Northern Asia. Almost all the species
of mammals to which I have referred as being of
Siberian origin have been found in the fossil state
in comparatively recent geological deposits within a
certain very limited area. None of the typical species
have ever been found in Southern Europe proper,
including the Mediterranean islands. It must be
remembered that though the Reindeer is a Siberian
migrant, the form of the Reindeer which was found
in the Pyrenees belonged to a distinct variety&mdash;in
fact, to a much earlier migration which issued from
the Arctic European Regions, and to which I have
referred in detail (pp. <a href="#Page_150">150</a>-<a href="#Page_158">158</a>). Curiously enough,
no deposits of these typical Siberian mammals
have ever been obtained in Scandinavia&mdash;only in
Russia, Austria, Switzerland (the lowlands), Germany,
Belgium, France, and England. To facilitate a study
of the extent of these migrations, I have constructed
a map on which the probable course taken across
Central Europe is roughly indicated by dots
(<a href="#Figure16">Fig. 16</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter">
  <a name="Figure16" id="Figure16"></a>

    <img src="images/figure16thumb.jpg" alt="" title="Fig. 16" />
  </a>
</div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span>&mdash;Map of Europe. The dotted portions represent, approximately,
the course of migration of the Siberian mammals. The
principal mountain ranges are roughly indicated in black.</p>

<p>In the migrations of to-day we perceive the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
tendency as in the older ones of which we have fossil
evidence, viz., generally a spreading of species on a
large scale over new territory, and then a gradual
shrinkage towards their original home, with an occasional
survival of small colonies in the invaded part.
It must not be supposed that this observation applies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
alone to the Siberian migration. In the case of the
Arctic one, precisely the same thing has happened,
and we shall see that the Southern (migration from
the south) agrees in this respect with the others.</p>

<p>As for the immediate cause of these migrations, it is
to be looked for either in the scarcity of food dependent
upon a temporary or permanent change of climate, or
in an excessive increase in numbers of a particular
species. I do not propose to trace back migrations
beyond the Pliocene Epoch, or indeed much beyond
the beginning of the Glacial period, which is regarded
as a phase of the most recent geological epoch, viz.,
the Pleistocene. During the period in question, we
have indirect evidence of one vast migration from
Siberia into Europe across the lowlands lying to the
north of the Caspian and to the south of the Ural
Mountains. There is a general consensus of opinion
that this migration took place in Pleistocene times.
Professor Nehring thinks that there can be no doubt
(p. 222) that the Siberian migrants arrived in
Northern Germany after the first stage or division
of the Glacial period, and lived there probably
during the inter-glacial phase which occurred between
the first and second stages&mdash;if indeed we look
upon this period as being divisible into two distinct
stages.</p>

<p>Judging from the evidence of distribution of
mammals in pleistocene Europe, Professor Boyd
Dawkins came to the conclusion (p. 113) that the
climate of our continent "was severe in the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and warm in the south, while in the middle zone,
comprising France, Germany, and the greater part
of Britain, the winters were cold and the summers
warm, as in Middle Asia and North America." "In
the summer time the southern species would pass
northwards, and in the winter time the northern
would swing southwards, and thus occupy at different
times of the year the same tract of ground, as is now
the case with the Elks and Reindeer." Very different
are the views of Professor Nehring on this subject.
According to him, the climate in Germany must
have been extremely cold and damp, resembling
that of Greenland, though perhaps not quite so
arctic. Professor Nehring does not at all believe
that southern and northern species of mammals could
have lived in Central or Northern Europe at the
same time; though of this we have undoubted geological
evidence (pp. <a href="#Page_72">72</a>-<a href="#Page_75">75</a>). He thinks that the
supposed commingling of southern and northern
types, which has actually been shown by Professor
Dawkins to occur, is either due to careless observation
or to the fact that some of the species need not
necessarily have lived where their bones were found
(p. 133).</p>

<p>The most reliable conclusions as regards former
conditions of vegetation and climate can be drawn,
according to Professor Nehring, from the smaller
burrowing mammals, such as the marmots, sousliks,
etc. He is of opinion that a great portion of
Northern Europe, where their remains have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
discovered, must have possessed tundras and steppes,
as we find them nowadays in Siberia, and a climate
similar to that of Northern Asia. It is presumed
that the climate, after the maximum cold of the first
stage of the Ice-Age, ameliorated so far as to permit
these mammals to exist in Europe.</p>

<p>The natural question, however, which is forced
upon us in reading Professor Nehring's interesting
and suggestive work is, where did all these steppe
animals live during the earlier part of the Ice-Age?
No traces of their remains have been discovered in
Southern Europe, and it can therefore certainly be
affirmed that they could not have lived there. If
Central and Northern Europe were uninhabitable
for mammals, Central and Northern Asia must have
been even more so, and we have to fall back upon the
Oriental Region as a possible home of these species
during the assumed maximum cold of the Glacial
period. In invading Europe from the Oriental
Region these Siberian mammals would have taken
the shorter route by Asia Minor and Greece, which
was open to them. This they certainly did not do,
which proves that they came directly from Siberia to
Europe without retreating first to Southern Asia.</p>

<p>But it seems to me that there is no necessity for
assuming such drastic changes of climate to have
taken place at all (compare pp. <a href="#Page_75">75</a>-<a href="#Page_80">80</a>). We really
have no idea under what precise climatic conditions
the Siberian mammals lived in their original home.
The only thing we can be certain of is that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
smaller burrowing mammals would not have chosen
a wood to live in, if they could possibly help it.
Prairies, or sand-dunes with short grass or shrubs,
such as abound in Europe near the sea-coast, would
suit these species perfectly. If we suppose Northern
Germany to have been covered by sea (p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>) during
part of the Pleistocene Epoch, forests would probably
not have grown there for a very considerable time
afterwards, owing to the excessive salinity of the soil,
but a tract of sandy country would have been left
on the retreat of the sea. Possibly a slight change
of climate in the original home of these steppe-species
may have reduced their habitable area, and thus
caused their migration into Europe.</p>

<p>But this migration problem cannot be solved
without tracing the mammals to their place of
origin and investigating their early history. This I
shall attempt to do presently; meanwhile, it would
be interesting to note whether other groups of
animals support Professor Nehring's steppe-theory.</p>

<p>Among groups other than mammals, the most
important, for the purpose of drawing conclusions
as to former physical conditions and climate, are the
mollusca. Their remains have been well preserved,
and are easily identified. Though Professor Nehring
argues that the molluscs found along with the small
mammals harmonise perfectly with the assumption
of a steppe-climate (p. 212), I cannot at all agree
with him. He enumerates the following sixteen
species as having been discovered by him:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Pupa muscorum.</li>
<li>Chondrula tridens.</li>
<li>Cionella lubrica.</li>
<li>Patula ruderata.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left:0.6em;margin-right:0.6em;">Do.</span>rotundata.</li>
<li>Helix striata.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left:0.6em;margin-right:0.6em;">Do.</span>hispidia.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left:0.6em;margin-right:0.6em;">Do.</span>tenuilabris.</li>
<li>Helix pulchella.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left:0.6em;margin-right:0.6em;">Do.</span>hortensis.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left:0.6em;margin-right:0.6em;">Do.</span>obvoluta.</li>
<li>Hyalinia radiatula.</li>
<li>Succinea oblonga.</li>
<li>Limnæa peregra.</li>
<li>Clausilia sp.</li>
<li>Pisidium pusillum.</li>
</ol>

<p>Only two of these can be looked upon as typically
northern species, viz., <i>Patula ruderata</i> and <i>Helix
tenuilabris</i>, though both of them are still found
living locally in Germany. Some of the others
are decidedly southern species, like <i>Chondrula tridens</i>,
<i>Helix obvoluta</i>, <i>H. rotundata</i>, and <i>H. striata</i>. All the
rest live and flourish, for example, in Ireland at the
present day, where, as we all know, anything but a
dry steppe-climate prevails.</p>

<p>Dr. Kobelt quite agrees with me in thinking that
the remains of the mollusca found along with the
so-called "steppe-mammals" afford no proof of a
steppe-character of the country at the time when
they were alive (p. 166). Nor do the mollusca which
have been found in England in the Forest-Bed and
the succeeding pleistocene strata support such a
view. The Forest-Bed, generally regarded as belonging
to the Upper Pliocene, I believe to be an inter-glacial
pleistocene deposit&mdash;contemporaneous with the
loess formation in Germany. Of fifty-nine species
of land and freshwater mollusca which have been
discovered in this bed, forty-eight species, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
to Mr. Clement Reid (p. 186), are at present living
in Norfolk, six are extinct, two are continental
forms living in the same latitudes as Norfolk, and the
other three are all southern forms. Not a single
species has a particularly northern range. Of the
land and freshwater mollusca of the South of England
in the succeeding pleistocene deposits, six
species are now no longer living in the British
Islands, but only one (<i>Helix ruderata</i>) can be looked
upon as an Arctic or Alpine form. After this short
digression on the mollusca, I will briefly recapitulate
what is known about the early history of the Siberian
mammals, which will assist us in tracing the cause of
their migration to Europe.</p>

<p>We have in Siberia problems quite as difficult of
solution as the European ones. Volumes have been
written to explain the former presence of Arctic
mammals like the Reindeer in Southern Europe, and
the most extraordinary demands on the credulity of
the public have been made by some geologists in
their attempts to account for this comparatively simple
problem. In Northern Asia a somewhat similar
phenomenon, but much more difficult of explanation,
has taken place. Mammals have been found fossil in
recent geological deposits in localities where they do
not now occur, and apparently the Siberian and the
European deposits are of about the same age. Now,
however, comes the extraordinary difference. In
Europe the Arctic mammals went southward, but
in Siberia the Southern ones went northward. Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
only do we find the Saiga-Antelope, Tiger, Wild
Horse, European Bison, Mammoth, and Rhinoceros
in the extreme north of the mainland of Siberia; their
remains have even been obtained in the New Siberian
Islands. As these islands are situated in the same
latitude as the northern part of Novaya Zemlya,&mdash;indeed,
not far south of the latitude of Spitsbergen,&mdash;the
fact of such huge mammals having been able
to find subsistence there at apparently quite a recent
geological period seems an astounding fact. It may
be urged that their bones might have been carried so
far north by ice, or by some other equally powerful
agency. But Tcherski and all other palæontologists
who have examined these northern deposits are
unanimous in the belief that these herbivores and
carnivores lived and died where their remains are
now found. "It is evident," says Tcherski (p. 451),
"that these large animals could only have lived in
those extremely northern latitudes under correspondingly
favourable conditions of the vegetation, viz.,
during the existence of forests, meadows, and
steppes." He also is of opinion that the moist climate
which evidently prevailed in Europe during Post-tertiary
(Pleistocene) times must have modified the
Siberian climate in so far as to render it milder.
The existence of the Aralo-Caspian basin (<a href="#Figure12">Fig. 12</a>,
p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>) must also have tended in the same direction.
It appears then that, at the time when plants and
animals are believed to have retired southward in
Europe before the supposed advancing Scandinavian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
ice-sheet, no agency existed in North Siberia which
was able to suppress and to annihilate the forest and
meadow vegetation, and drive away the fauna connected
with it. We know, continues Tcherski, that
such genera as Bison, Colus (<i>Saiga</i>), Rhinoceros,
Elephas, and Equus are met with in all horizons
of the diluvium of West Siberia. He therefore
comes to the conclusion (p. 474), that these and
other facts imply that the retreat of the North
Asiatic fauna commenced about the end of the
Tertiary Era (Pliocene), and that it was continued
very slowly throughout the Post-tertiary (Pleistocene)
Epoch, without any visible changes in its southward
direction, even <i>during the time of the most important
glacial developments in Northern Europe</i>. Only after
the conditions disappeared which had produced the
augmentation of an atmospheric moisture, did the
climate of North Siberia become deadly to a
temperate fauna and flora. Tundras then spread
over the meadow-lands and remnants of forests,
whilst arctic animals replaced the large ungulates
and carnivores which had wandered far away from
their native southern home.</p>

<p>This is Tcherski's explanation of the extraordinary
events which he has chronicled, after years of the
most arduous labour and under conditions of peculiar
hardship. And though his work cannot be over-estimated,
and his opinions should receive the most
careful consideration, yet I fear the explanation will
not be looked upon as entirely satisfactory. Every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
will agree with him that the climate of Siberia must
have been greatly moister in pliocene and pleistocene
times than it is now. The Aralo-Caspian covered
a vast area of South-western Siberia. Freshwater
basins existed along the east of the Ural Mountains,
while Central Asia was studded over with a number of
large lakes, which have now almost entirely vanished.
But that the generally assumed refrigeration of
Europe must have had a chilling effect on the
Siberian atmosphere seems to me evident. That the
whole of Northern Europe should have been made
uninhabitable owing to the advance of the Scandinavian
ice-sheet, while North Siberia at the same
time supported forests, meadows, and a temperate
fauna, is incredible. At the approach of winter, at
any rate, the animals would have been driven southward
for thousands of miles to seek shelter from the
snows and cold and to obtain nourishment, and it
would scarcely have been possible for them to
undertake such vast migrations at every season.
Professor James Geikie's suggestion (p. 706), that
the Mammoth and Woolly Rhinoceros could have
survived the Pleistocene Epoch in Southern Siberia,
does not appear to solve the problem, as that part
of Asia must have participated in the great cold
which is said to have prevailed all over Europe.</p>

<p>Let us now concede, for the sake of argument,
that the current views regarding the pleistocene
climate of Europe are correct. We are told by Professor
Geikie that the climate of Scotland during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
part of the Pleistocene Epoch was so cold, that the
whole country was buried underneath one immense
<i>mer de glace</i>, through which peered only the higher
mountain-tops (p. 67). If this was the state of climate
in close proximity to the Atlantic, it must probably
have been still more severe on the European continent.
Now at the present time Siberia has the
reputation of being the coldest country in the world,
and the mercury of the thermometer is said to remain
frozen for weeks during winter, even in the south.</p>

<p>With the prevailing dampness in pleistocene times
the snowfall throughout Siberia would have been
much heavier than at present, though it would have
modified the temperature to some extent. Under
such circumstances Southern Siberia could not have
been a desirable place of residence for large mammals.
It would have been necessary for the Mammoth and
the other species referred to, to wander farther into
the extreme south of Asia or Europe to find a
suitable refuge during the arctic conditions which
are supposed to have prevailed in Northern Europe.
To quote Professor J. Geikie's own words (p. 706):
"They (Mammoth, etc.) would seem to have lived in
Southern Siberia throughout the whole Pleistocene
period, from which region doubtless they originally invaded
our Continent. But with the approach of our
genial forest-epoch (penultimate inter-glacial stage)
they gradually vanished from Europe, to linger for a
long time in Siberia before they finally died out."
It is suggested, therefore, by the author that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Mammoth and the other mammals whose remains
have been discovered on the New Siberian Islands
found their way there during one of the late inter-glacial
stages of the Ice-Age. But there is no
astonishment expressed by Professor Geikie at the
extraordinary change of climate which must have
occurred in Siberia to allow of such migrations. I
can find no very definite statement in this author's
work as to the nature of the climate in Europe during
those inter-glacial phases, but he remarks (p. 129)
"that the evidence of the Scottish inter-glacial beds,
so far as it went, did not entitle us to infer that
during their accumulation local glaciers may not
have existed in the Highland valleys." There is no
evidence, in other words, of the existence in Europe
of a milder climate than that prevailing at present.
Still less can there be any ground for the supposition
that the climate of the whole of Siberia ameliorated
to such an extent that forests and meadows could
develop as far north as the New Siberian Islands;
for if the temperature in Europe was then about
the same as now, that of Siberia could not have
been vastly higher than it is at present.</p>

<p>It is highly improbable, therefore, that a sufficiently
mild climate prevailed in the extreme north of
Siberia during the so-called <i>later inter-glacial periods</i>
to induce the mammals to which I have referred to
seek fresh pastures there.</p>

<p>The late Professor Brandt, one of the highest
zoological authorities in Russia, was of opinion that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
at the commencement of the Glacial period the great
mammals of Northern Siberia either perished or
migrated southward. From there they gradually
penetrated into European Russia. He believed that
before the Glacial period a connection existed
between the Aralo-Caspian Sea and the Arctic
Ocean, carrying warm water northward. The gradual
disappearance of this marine channel caused a
decrease of warmth in Northern Asia, so that large
accumulations of frozen soil and ice were formed,
which still more depressed the temperature. This,
he suggested, probably took place at the time when
the Glacial period commenced in North-western
Europe.</p>

<p>It has been urged against these views of Tcherski
and Brandt, that the bone beds in the Liakov Islands
(New Siberian Islands) rest partly upon a solid layer
of ice of nearly seventy feet thick. This mass of ice,
it was thought, must have accumulated during the
Glacial period. As the bones rest upon it, the
mammals could only have lived in those islands in
more recent times, after the Ice-Age had passed away.
Nothing, apparently, can be clearer, and yet in the
face of this seeming proof one feels, as I have mentioned
before, that if such an extraordinary revolution
of climate as is implied by this admission had taken
place, we should be able to perceive the traces
throughout the northern hemisphere. In this dilemma,
a suggestion made by Dr. Bunge, who visited
the New Siberian Islands recently at the instance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg, helps
us out of the difficulty. He found that, as a
rule, these so-called fossil glaciers contain seams
of mud and sand, and he argued that the ice had
formed, and is still forming at the present day, in
fissures of the earth. I entirely concur with this
view. Neither palæontology nor the geographical
distribution of animals lend any support to the other
theory, and I think we may conclude that Brandt's
view in the main is probably the correct explanation
of the phenomena which we have discussed. Some
important facts of distribution are more easily explicable
on this assumption. Why, for instance, should
the Siberian fauna of pliocene times have remained
in Siberia and not have migrated to Europe at that
time? The pliocene mammals of Siberia are mostly
of southern origin. Their range increased enormously
during the epoch throughout Northern Asia. We
should expect them, therefore, to have crossed the
Caspian plains, or even the low-lying Ural Mountains,
to pour into the neighbouring continent. But Professor
Brandt explained how they were prevented
from spreading west. An arm of the sea stretched
from the Aralo-Caspian to the Arctic Ocean, thus
raising an effectual barrier between the two continents.
There is some evidence for the belief, as we
shall learn presently, that this marine barrier existed
also during the early part of the pleistocene epoch.
After having greatly expanded during pliocene times,
the fauna of Siberia gradually withdrew from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
northern regions during the earlier portion of the
succeeding epoch. It was only after the marine
connection above referred to ceased to exist, or
became disconnected, that an entry into Europe
was possible.</p>

<p>A fauna, to some extent composed of species now
inhabiting the steppes of Eastern Europe and Siberia,
poured into the neighbouring continent. On p. <a href="#Page_95">95</a> I
have given a list of those which reached as far west
as the British Islands, but, as I mentioned, many
other species came from the east about this time.
With regard to the early history of the Siberian
mammals, I favour a view somewhat between that
of Tcherski and that of Brandt. The outpouring of
the fauna into Europe seems to me to indicate that
there was a sudden change of climate in Siberia.
This was produced, perhaps, by the rupture of the
marine connection between the Arctic Ocean and
the Aralo-Caspian. Such an event would not only
have caused the sudden shrinkage of the area available
for food-supply by lowering the temperature in
Siberia, it would have acted also as a means in
assisting the fauna to enter a new continent where
an inconsiderable number of mammals, already established,
were mostly dispossessed of their homes by the
advancing eastern host.</p>

<p>Brandt's theory, however, of a marine connection
between the Arctic Ocean and the Aralo-Caspian is
by no means generally accepted. That the Caspian
Sea was at that time greatly larger than it is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
present, and joined to the Sea of Aral and the Black
Sea, is acknowledged by everybody. That the
deposits laid down by this huge inland sea reach
as far north as the shores of the river Kama, in
Central Russia, is also well known to geologists.
But what comes rather as a surprise, is that Professor
Karpinski, whom we must take as one of the highest
authorities on the geology of Russia, asserts that this
Aralo-Caspian Sea was probably joined by a system
of lakes or channels to the Arctic Ocean (p. 183). He
was by no means the first, though, to put forward
such a theory. We have already learned that Professor
Brandt held a somewhat similar view, though he
believed in something more than a connection by
mere channels, and Mr. Köppen, and also the Russian
traveller Mr. Kessler, agreed with him. So much
was Professor Boyd Dawkins impressed with their
arguments at the time, that he wrote (<i>c</i>, p. 148):
"Before the lowering of the temperature in Central
Europe, the sea had already rolled through the low
country of Russia, from the Caspian to the White
Sea and the Baltic, and formed a barrier to western
migration to the Arctic mammals of Asia."</p>

<p>In one particular Professor Dawkins's views differ
from those of almost all the previous writers. His
connection between the Caspian and the Arctic
Ocean is placed to the west of the Ural Mountains,
while it had always been assumed by the Russian
writers to have lain on the eastern or Asiatic side of
that mountain range. Thus, when Tcherski in recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
years announced that the tract on this eastern side of
the mountains was covered by freshwater deposits,
his discovery seemed once for all to settle the problem
of the arctic marine connection in the negative. As
Professor Dawkins's theory has, however, received
much additional affirmative evidence by current
faunal researches, a connection between the Caspian
(or Aralo-Caspian) and the Arctic Ocean (White Sea)
may have actually existed within recent geological
times.</p>

<p>What <i>relict lakes</i> are, has already been explained
(p. <a href="#Page_176">176</a>), and their fauna will again be referred to in
a subsequent chapter. I might perhaps be allowed
to repeat that such lakes are supposed to have been
flooded by, or to have been in close connection with,
the sea at some former period. Many of the Swedish
lakes are spoken of as relict lakes (Reliktenseen),
because they contain a number of marine species of
animals which have now become adapted to live in
fresh water, but all of whose nearest relatives inhabit
the sea. One of these, the schizopod crustacean <i>Mysis
relicta</i>,&mdash;a shrimp-like creature,&mdash;which was formerly
believed to inhabit also the Caspian, is of particular
interest. More recently, the occurrence of this <i>Mysis</i>
in the Caspian was denied, but though this denial has
been confirmed by Professor Sars in his memoir on
the crustaceans of the great Russian inland sea, he
has been enabled to add two new species of <i>Mysis</i>
to the list of those already known to science. These
are <i>M. caspia</i> and <i>M. micropthalma</i>, and both are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
closely related to the arctic marine <i>Mysis oculata</i>.
According to Professor Sars, the genus <i>Mysis</i> as a
whole may be regarded as arctic in character. The
occurrence of these two species, therefore, in his
opinion, points to a recent connection of the Caspian
with the Glacial Sea.</p>

<p>A large number of other crustaceans have been
described by the same author from the Caspian. Of
the order Cumacea, which is exclusively marine,
ten species are mentioned, but none of these seems
to range beyond the Caspian. Among the smaller
species of crustaceans, a minute pelagic copepod
(<i>Limnocalanus grimaldii</i>) also inhabits the Baltic
and the Arctic Ocean. The marine isopod <i>Idotea
entomon</i>, related to the common wood-louse, has a
similar distribution.</p>

<p>Genuine Arctic species of Fishes do not seem to
occur in the Caspian, though some, viz., <i>Clupea
caspia</i>, <i>Atherina pontica</i>, <i>Clupionella Grimmi</i>, and
<i>Syngnathus bucculentus</i>, are almost certainly the
descendants of marine forms.</p>

<p>The Seal of the Caspian (<i>Phoca caspica</i>) is closely
allied to the Arctic Seal, and its presence alone in
that sea indicates that at no very distant date&mdash;at
any rate since pliocene times&mdash;a closer connection
with the Arctic Ocean existed than at present.</p>

<p>I am sure it will be readily granted that there is
zoological evidence for the belief of such a connection
or union between the two great seas. However, it
may be urged that owing to the presence of an ice-sheet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>in Northern Europe during the Glacial period,
such a connection must either have been pre-glacial
or have existed after that period. But the connection
must have occurred at a time when the Caspian
extended far to the north&mdash;when indeed the so-called
post-tertiary Caspian deposits were laid down (<a href="#Figure17">Fig. 17</a>).
Since the boulder-clay which covers the plain
of Northern Russia is assumed to be the ground-moraine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>of the great northern ice-sheet, we might
expect to find that the Caspian deposits were not
contemporaneous with it. Curiously enough, it has
been shown by Mr. Sjögren that all observations
have pointed to the fact that these two deposits do
not overlie one another, but occur side by side,
and are therefore contemporaneous. This seems to
warrant our belief, that while the boulder-clay was
being laid down in Northern Europe, the Aralo-Caspian
Sea had some communication with the
White Sea.</p>

dotted parts indicate the areas covered by boulder-clay, the
strongly dotted ones those exhibiting Aralo-Caspian and other
post-pliocene deposits.</p>

<p>The boulder-clay of Northern Continental Europe,
as already stated, is now generally recognised to
be the product of a huge ice-sheet which invaded
the lowlands of Continental Europe from the Scandinavian
mountains. Though Alpine glaciers at the
present day produce little or no ground moraine,
these ancient larger ice-sheets, or "mers de glace," are
believed to have deposited immense layers of mud
containing scratched and polished stones. Many of
the latter have been carried great distances from
their source of origin. The Scandinavian ice-sheet
is supposed to have advanced as far south as the
line indicated on the map, after which it gradually
retreated. On this point, however, as in almost every
detail connected with the Glacial period, geologists
are at variance. Professor James Geikie maintains,
that there were no less than four Glacial periods,
separated from one another by milder inter-glacial
phases. On the Continent the view of two Glacial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
and one inter-glacial period is, I think, more generally
adopted. Professor Geikie's four periods seem
to me to have originated in a desire to correlate
the British pleistocene deposits with the continental
ones, and at the same time to retain the old view of
the inter-glacial position of the Forest-Bed. The
two theories agree in so far as that in both the
glacial conditions culminate in a maximum glaciation,
followed by a more temperate phase of climate,
with consequent retreat of the ice-sheets, and finally
by a renewed advance of the glaciers.</p>

<p>We are told that there is not the slightest doubt
about it that a marked but gradual decrease of
temperature took place all over Europe either
during the beginning of the Pleistocene or towards
the end of the Pliocene Epoch.</p>

<p>We might reasonably suppose, then, that a similar
climatic effect was produced in Siberia, in consequence
of which the fauna would have been
obliged to retreat from the extreme northern latitudes
southward. No doubt great efforts would
have been made by the members of the Siberian
fauna&mdash;at any rate by those possessing strong
power of locomotion&mdash;to extend their range in
other directions. But we have no evidence that
a migration from Siberia came to Eastern Europe
at that time. It seems, therefore, as if the barrier
referred to by Brandt, Köppen, Boyd Dawkins,
and others (p. 222), had existed at this time. This
would have effectually prevented an overflow of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the fauna from Siberia. Only in deposits later
than the lower continental boulder-clay do we find
traces of a Siberian migration. The time of maximum
glaciation had then passed away; the great
glacier which was believed to have invaded the
lowlands of Northern Europe had again retreated,
before the Siberian mammals made their appearance
in Germany.</p>

<p>It has been stated above (p. <a href="#Page_226">226</a>) that while the
Russian boulder-clay was being laid down, the Aralo-Caspian
probably had some communication with the
White Sea.</p>

<p>But how can this view be reconciled with the
existence of a huge <i>mer de glace</i> in the northern
plains of Russia? The existence of the ice-sheet
has been conjured up in order to explain the
presence of the boulder-clay. But not long ago a
very different interpretation of the origin of this clay
was given; and one, I may say, which explains the
history of the Siberian and the European fauna in a
more satisfactory manner than is done by the ice-sheet
hypothesis. It is that the boulder-clay is not
the product of land-ice, but has been deposited by a
sea with floating icebergs. Thus the latter hypothesis
does not deny the existence of glaciers, but allows
the mud to be deposited on the floor of a turbid
sea, instead of beneath an immense <i>mer de glace</i>. I
need hardly mention that this view, which was
formerly universally accepted by geologists, is now
scouted by almost every authority, both British and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Continental. I should scarcely venture the attempt
to revive old memories and stir up again long
forgotten controversies, were it not for the fact that
many new points have arisen in the course of the
above inquiries, which appear to me so very difficult
to explain by the land-ice hypothesis, while they are
comparatively easy to understand when we adopt
the old theory of the marine origin of the boulder-clay.
But a few geologists even at the present day,
while believing in the land-ice theory, recognise that
the marine hypothesis should have some consideration
shown to it. I need only remind glacialists of the
work recently published by Professor Bonney. "The
singular mixture," he remarks (p. 280), "and apparent
crossing of the paths of boulders, as already stated,
are less difficult to explain on the hypothesis of
distribution by floating ice than on that of transport
by land-ice, because, in the former case, though the
drift of winds and currents would be generally in one
direction, both might be varied at particular seasons.
So far as concerns the distribution and thickness of
the glacial deposits, there is not much to choose
between either hypothesis; but on that of land-ice
it is extremely difficult to explain the intercalation of
perfectly stratified sands and gravels and of boulder-clay,
as well as the not infrequent signs of bedding
in the latter."</p>

<p>Now with regard to the land-ice theory, several
serious difficulties present themselves in connection
with the origin of the European fauna. In the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
place, as the climate renders Northern Siberia
almost uninhabitable for mammals at the present
day, how much more severe must it have been
during the time of the maximum glaciation in
Europe. As the then existing fauna was not
driven into Europe, where could it possibly have
survived? Secondly, how can we reconcile the
contemporaneous existence of a great inland sea
(the Aralo-Caspian) containing survivals of mild
Sarmatic times with an immense glacier almost
touching it on its northern shores? How did
one of the most characteristic species of that sea,
<i>Dreyssensia polymorpha</i>, come to make its appearance
in the lower boulder-clay of Prussia and then disappear
in the upper? And finally, how are we to
explain the sudden appearance of a Siberian fauna
after the deposition of the lower boulder-clay, except
by the removal of a barrier which had prevented
their egress from Siberia?</p>

<p>If we assume that the continental boulder-clay of
Russia has been formed in the manner so ably
explained by Murchison, de Verneuil, and von Keyserling,
viz., by a sea with floating icebergs, the
temperature of Siberia might have been higher than
at present, and have supported a fauna in more
northern latitudes.</p>

<p>The contemporaneousness of the deposits of this
sea with those of the Aralo-Caspian is also rendered
more intelligible. If we suppose, moreover, the connection
between the Aralo-Caspian and the White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Sea (<a href="#Figure12">Fig. 12</a>, p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>) to have existed at this time, we
possess an explanation of the method of migration of
the Arctic marine species into the Southern and of
the Caspian species (<i>Dreyssensia</i>) into the Northern
Sea.</p>

<p>An inter-glacial phase is believed to have supervened
after the deposition of the lower boulder-clay,
and it is during this period that the Siberian species
first appeared in Central Europe. If we assume then
that the retreat of the Northern Sea (<a href="#Figure13">Fig. 13</a>, p. <a href="#Page_170">170</a>)
opened up a passage for the Siberian fauna, we have in
this very fact also an explanation of the extraordinarily
large exodus of Asiatic mammals, because the great
reduction of the marine area in Northern Europe
would have had an important influence in lowering
the temperature in Asia. Only a sudden change of
climate in Siberia could have brought about the
migration of the vast hordes of Asiatic mammals
whose remains we find in Central and Western
Europe in deposits of that period.</p>

<p>Throughout this work we are made acquainted
with facts which bear out the view that the climate
during the greater part of the Glacial period was
mild rather than intensely arctic in Europe. That
a huge ice-sheet could have covered Northern Europe
under such conditions appears to me very doubtful.
No one can deny, however, that glaciers must
have existed during the Glacial period in all the
mountainous regions of Central and Northern
Europe, though their existence is not incompatible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
with a mild climate. Tree-ferns and other tropical
vegetation grow at the foot of glaciers in New
Zealand. We need not even go so far afield, for in
Switzerland grapes ripen and an abundant fauna and
flora thrive in close proximity to some of the well-known
glaciers.</p>

<p>One matter of importance still remains to be considered
before concluding this chapter, viz., the
fauna contained in the English geological deposit
known as the "Forest-Bed." This interesting
deposit is exposed at the base of a range of cliffs
on the coast of Norfolk. It is composed of beds
of estuarine and marine origin. The tree-stumps
formerly believed to be the remains of trees <i>in situ</i>
have, after more careful examination, proved to be
in all cases drifted specimens. A portion of the
"Forest-Bed" no doubt was laid down in close proximity
to a large river, and subject to being periodically
flooded by it. It is not absolutely certain, therefore,
that all the mammals whose remains occur in
this deposit lived in England or whether only on the
banks of the river farther south. Nevertheless, we
may take for granted that some of them did.
England was at the time connected with France
and Belgium, and for our purpose it matters little
whether they had crossed the Channel or inhabited
those parts of the Continent through which the great
river flowed which sent its alluvial detritus as far as
the plains of Norfolk. All we have to remember
is that certain mammals, which appear to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
originated in Siberia, and of which we have some
evidence that they crossed Central Europe in their
westward course, had now reached the great river
just alluded to, which some geologists believe to have
been the Rhine.</p>

<p>I have had occasion to refer to a number of British
mammals (p. <a href="#Page_202">202</a>)&mdash;some of which are now extinct&mdash;which
I believe to have migrated across the plains of
continental Europe direct from Siberia. There were
twenty-six species of these Siberian mammals; and no
less than ten of these occur in the Forest-Bed. None
appear in any older British deposit. It is perfectly
clear, therefore, that the Forest-Bed must have been
laid down after their immigration into Europe. They
probably wandered to Western Europe very soon
after crossing the eastern boundaries of our continent;
the deposits in which they are found are therefore
contemporaneous. But we have learned above
(p. <a href="#Page_208">208</a>), that the beds in Eastern Europe in which the
Siberian mammal-remains are found are more recent
than the lower boulder-clay. As already stated, the
Forest-Bed must also be more recent than the lower
continental boulder-clay, and should be included in
the pleistocene series.</p>

<p>That the Forest-Bed is an inter-glacial deposit has
been urged long ago by various writers. Professor
Geikie regards it as stratigraphically contemporaneous
with the peat and freshwater beds below the
lower diluvium of Western and Middle Germany, and
as having been laid down during the first Inter-glacial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Epoch of the great Ice-Age. The fact that no
boulder-clay underlies the Forest-Bed seems rather
a strong argument against the view of its being an
inter-glacial deposit. It lies directly on what is
known as the Newer Pliocene Crags. If the Forest-Bed
is included in the pleistocene series, as I suggested
it should, the crags, or a portion of them,
would therefore be equivalent as regards time of
deposition to the lower continental boulder-clay.
And again, if the lower continental boulder-clay is
contemporaneous with the Newer Crags, the latter
should also be classed with the pleistocene strata. I
can scarcely hope that geologists will be ready to
admit such a sweeping change of nomenclature
without a protest. I venture, therefore, to explain
more fully my reasons for adhering to these unorthodox
views.</p>

<p>Let us look once more at the map which I constructed
(<a href="#Figure12">Fig. 12</a>, p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>) to elucidate the migration
of the Arctic terrestrial species to the British Islands.
It will be noticed that one continuous ocean extends
from the east coast of England across Holland,
Northern Germany, and Russia to the White Sea.
At the same time Greenland and Northern Scandinavia,
Scotland and Southern Scandinavia, are united
by a narrow strip of land, and so are England and
France. The waters of the Atlantic and this North
European Sea do not therefore intermingle at any
point, the two seas being absolutely independent of
one another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p><p>Such I assume to have been the geographical condition
of Northern Europe during the deposition of
the Red Crag. Arctic mollusca were then brought
to the east coast of England, and boulders were
scattered through the beds laid down on that coast
by icebergs which had been cast off by Scandinavian
glaciers on reaching the sea. Bedded clays which
have yielded arctic shells lie beneath the lower continental
boulder-clay on the Baltic coast-lands and on
the coast of the White Sea. According to Professor
Geikie, marine clays on the same geological horizon
reach an elevation of some 230 feet. "It would seem,
then," he says, "that before the deposition of the
lower boulder-clay of those regions the Baltic Sea
had open communication with the German Ocean"
(p. 442). All these clays are evidently deposits of the
same sea. But apart from the fact that the Red Crag
and these Baltic deposits are the oldest of the upper
Tertiary beds containing arctic shells, there is no
evidence that they are contemporaneous.</p>

<p>Overlying the same Baltic deposits comes the lower
boulder-clay, reaching a thickness of several hundred
feet in some parts of Germany. It presents, like the
upper clay, frequent interstratification with well-bedded
deposits of sand and gravel. The scarcity of
marine mollusca, the occurrence of striated surfaces,
and the occasional presence of so-called giants'
kettles, appear to favour the view, which at present
is generally adopted by both British and Continental
geologists, that the boulder-clay owes its origin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
land-ice. I have stated on several occasions that the
view of the marine origin of the boulder-clay agrees
best with the known facts of distribution, and with
the history of the European fauna (pp. <a href="#Page_80">80</a>-<a href="#Page_86">86</a>, and
p. <a href="#Page_129">129</a>). It may be urged that if the lower boulder-clay
were contemporaneous with the British Crags
which succeeded the Red Crag, how can we explain
the fact that these crags contain plenty of shells,
while in the lower continental boulder-clay there
are scarcely any?</p>

<p>But as yet our knowledge of the conditions of life
of the marine mollusca and of their distribution is
extremely scanty. We are apt to imagine that the
bottom of the sea is covered by a more or less
uniform thick layer of shells; but whenever a careful
survey of the nature of the deposits now forming
there has been made, such is by no means found to
be the case. Some of the best results obtained by
that useful body, the Liverpool Marine Biological
Committee, have been precisely in this direction.
A most interesting account has been published by
Professor Herdman and Mr. Lomas on the floor
deposits of the Irish Sea, in which the authors state
(p. 217), that "a place may be swarming with life
and yet leave no trace of anything capable of being
preserved in the fossil state, whereas in other places,
barren of living things, banks of drifted and dead
shells may be found, and remain as a permanent
deposit on the ocean floor."</p>

<p>Owing to the fact of the peculiar geographical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
position of Scandinavia at this time&mdash;an isthmus of
land with a high mountain range lying between the
warm Atlantic and the cold Arctic Sea&mdash;the snowfall
must have been excessive, and large glaciers were
evidently forming. These produced icebergs as soon
as the lower parts had advanced to the Baltic coast-land
and deposited their detritus in the sea. Immense
masses of mud and stones were thus cast to the
bottom of the sea, and under these circumstances no
delicate mollusca or other marine life probably could
have developed within a considerable distance from
the shore. To judge from the direction pursued by
the majority of the boulders from their source of
origin, the prevailing current during the deposition of
the lower boulder-clay was from north-west to south-east.
It is possible that little marine life, except
free-swimming forms, would have been able to live
within the Russian area of this sea. But the free-swimming
larvæ of molluscs and other surface
species were not prevented from passing from the
White Sea south-westward, and in sheltered localities
where little or no mud deposition was going on,
these no doubt might have developed into adults
on the sea-floor. It is quite conceivable, therefore,
that in one portion of the North European Sea, which
was fully exposed to the destructive influences of the
iceberg action, the fauna was scanty or totally absent,
while in another part there lived a fairly abundant
one. The unfossiliferous state of the lower continental
boulder-clay does not, therefore, offer any serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
difficulty to the supposition that some of the so-called
Newer Pliocene Crags of the east coast of
England were laid down at the same time by the
same sea.</p>

<p>This would also explain how the Arctic species
come to inhabit the Caspian, as the old Aralo-Caspian
Sea could have had some communication (<a href="#Figure12">Fig. 12</a>,
p. <a href="#Page_156">156</a>) with the North European Sea. And this again
offers an explanation of the otherwise mysterious
occurrence of the Caspian <i>Dreyssensia polymorpha</i>
in the lower continental boulder-clay.</p>

<p>The climatic reasons for the supposition that the
boulder-clay is a marine deposit have already been
given (p. <a href="#Page_66">66</a>). However, it may be asked what about
the glacial flora which has been proved to have existed
all over the plains of Northern Europe?&mdash;what about
the relics of this same flora which still linger on in a
few localities to the great delight of the systematic
botanist? They have been spoken of as indications of
a former Arctic climate in Europe. The presence of
an Arctic species such as <i>Dryas octopetala</i> in any of
the pleistocene deposits is often looked upon as an
absolute proof of a very severe climate having prevailed
at the time they were laid down. Professor
Geikie tells us that the South of England was
clothed with an Arctic flora, when the climate became
somewhat less severe than it had been during
the climax of the glacial cold (p. 398). Relics of
such a flora have been detected at Bovey Tracey, in
Devonshire, the Arctic plants found comprising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
<i>Betula nana</i> and <i>B. alba</i>, <i>Salix cinerea</i> and <i>Arctostaphylos
uva-ursi</i>.</p>

<p>Now three of these four species of plants are still
natives in the British Islands, and all are forms
which probably came to us with the Arctic migration
which I described in Chapter IV. They travelled
south with the reindeer, or before it, and may have
covered large tracts of country at the time. With the
increased struggle for existence on the arrival of the
Siberian and Oriental migrants, they have probably
been evicted by these more powerful rivals. A
discovery of their remains does not necessarily
indicate that a great change of climate has taken
place since they lived in the country. And certainly
these Arctic plants cannot be taken as indicating a
low temperature, for it has been shown that Alpine
plants are mostly intolerant of very low temperatures.
"Arctic and Alpine species in the Botanical Gardens
at Christiania," says Professor Blytt (p. 19), "endure
the strongest summer heat without injury, while they
are often destroyed when not sufficiently covered
during the winter." Similar observations have been
made in other countries. For this reason they have
to be generally wintered in frames in the Botanic
Gardens at Kew and Dublin, and are thus exposed to
higher temperatures than at present obtain in the
British Islands. This fact suggests that the Alpine
and Arctic plants really did not originate in countries
with cold temperatures. They probably made their
first appearance long before the Glacial period&mdash;perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>in early Tertiary times&mdash;chiefly in the Arctic
Regions, which at that time had a mild climate.
They have since become adapted to live in cold
countries where they flourish, provided they receive
sufficient moisture in the summer, and are protected
from severe frost in the winter by a covering of snow.</p>

<p>When we carefully examine the present range
of Arctic plants in the British Islands, a curious
fact presents itself which no doubt has frequently
been noted by botanists, viz., that some of the most
characteristically Arctic species, and some which
are often quoted by glacialists in support of their
theories, flourish at the present moment in very
mild situations. I have already referred to the fact
that the Mountain Avens (<i>Dryas octopetala</i>) abounds
in the west of Ireland (County Galway) down to sea-level.
Now it is well known that the mean winter
temperature of that part of Ireland resembles that
of Southern Europe, being no less than 12° F.
(=7° Cent.) above freezing point. The plant, of
course, is here a native, and not introduced. This
instance shows clearly, that as long as more vigorous
competitors are absent, and as long as it is not
exposed to severe frost or undue dryness, this and
allied species do just as well in a mild climate as in
their native Arctic home.</p>

<p>In his interesting essay on the distribution of the
Arctic plants in Europe during the Glacial period,
Professor Nathorst adduces the fact that all the
localities but one, in which remains of such plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
have been discovered, lie either within or close to
the limits of the maximum extension of the supposed
northern ice-sheet, or within those of the former
Alpine glaciers. Whether we look upon the boulder-clay
as a marine or a terrestrial product, it is quite
conceivable that, in many instances, the remains of
the Arctic plants may have been carried by ice to
great distances from where they grew. The probability,
however, is in favour of most of them
having lived where their remains are now found.
Now, it is a remarkable fact, that the single instance
in Europe of a deposit of Arctic plants having been
found far removed from the maximum extension
of the northern ice-sheet is the one quoted above,
viz., at Bovey Tracey, in Devonshire. Even up
to recent times Arctic plants may have persisted at
Bovey Tracey just as they do in Galway under the
influence of a mild coast climate. Similar circumstances
may have led to their survival along the
shores of the sea which deposited the North
European boulder-clay, while they moved northward
from the Alps along with the glaciers, which
always supplied them with an abundance of moisture.
Alpine plants probably became exterminated in the
plain of Central Europe at a much earlier period.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p><h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER V.</h3>

<p>What has been spoken of in the earlier parts of this book as the
eastern migration, refers in a general way to the animals which
have come to England from the east. But these are by no means
natives of one country alone. We can trace a number of the
British mammals to a Siberian origin, and also some birds;
among many of the lower vertebrates and invertebrates, however,
there are few species which have reached us from Siberia.
They may have had their original homes in the Alps, in Eastern
Europe, or in Central and Southern Asia, and have joined in
their westward course the later, more quickly travelling
mammals. Many instances are given from all the more important
groups of animals to show how we may proceed in
approximately identifying the home of a species.</p>

<p>The periodical invasion into our continent of Pallas's Sandgrouse
and other birds, suggests an explanation as to the cause
of the great westward migration in former times of the Siberian
mammals. Since a considerable amount of fossil evidence is
available to show the path of migration pursued by these
mammals, other important problems, such as the time of their
arrival in Europe and the geographical conditions surrounding
them, may perhaps be approximately ascertained, and thus
throw much light on the general features of the European
fauna. It has been proved by Professor Nehring that the
Siberian mammals arrived in Eastern Europe after the deposition
of the lower continental boulder-clay. He believes
that the climate of Germany at that time had ameliorated so
far, after the maximum cold of the Glacial period, that steppes
with a Siberian fauna could exist. Other groups, such as the
Mollusca, however, do not support Professor Nehring's theory,
and in order to arrive at an independent solution of this and the
other problems referred to, a short history is given of the Siberian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
fauna. Recent geological ages have witnessed the arrival in
Southern Europe of mammals now almost confined to the arctic
and subarctic regions. In Siberia, on the other hand, many
southern species penetrated, apparently about the same time,
to the extreme northern limits of that country. The greatest
authority on the Siberian fossil fauna, Tcherski, believes that
this took place in pliocene times, the gradual retreat occupying
the whole of the Glacial period. If this were correct, the
retreat from the Arctic Regions would have occurred at
the same time when, according to our European authorities,
Professors Nehring and Geikie, the much more southern
parts of our continent were already uninhabitable. But
Siberia could not have supported the large mammals at all
at a time when Europe was uninhabitable, as it would be
difficult to conceive under what geographical conditions the
climate of the latter was arctic and that of the former temperate.
If the whole fauna was driven into Southern Asia, how is it that
the Siberian invasion of Europe occurred immediately after the
deposition of the lower boulder-clay, that is to say, after the
earlier part of the Glacial period? The difficulty can be met by
the supposition that both Europe and Siberia had a temperate
climate at that time. This view is supported by certain
evidences, fully described, of a connection between the Caspian
and the White Sea, which would have had the effect of influencing
the climate. The Siberian fauna would thus have been
prevented from spreading westward in Pliocene and early
Glacial times. But on the disappearance of the marine connection,
a way would have been opened into our continent,
which again had an effect on the climate. The latter would
have become sensibly colder and thus have reduced the
habitable area of the Siberian fauna.</p>

<p>Such geographical conditions would have been incompatible
with a great northern <i>mer de glace</i>, and the boulder-clay in
Northern Europe could not have represented a ground moraine
but is a marine deposit. The sea is supposed to have covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
the Northern Russian and German plains, and into it icebergs
discharged the detritus which had accumulated on them when
they were still Scandinavian glaciers.</p>

<p>As regards the time of the arrival of the Siberian migrants in
Europe, the English Forest-Bed gives us an additional clue to
its determination. Since Siberian migrants are unknown from
earlier deposits than this, it is reasonable to suppose that they
arrived in England about the time when it was laid down. But
since they appear in Germany in the inter-glacial beds subsequent
to the deposition of the lower boulder-clay, the former are
probably contemporaneous with the Forest-Bed. Some of the
deposits generally regarded as upper pliocene by British geologists
would therefore have to be classed with the lower
continental boulder-clay as lower pleistocene. In connection
with this theory some interesting faunistic data are given
which seem to support it.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the former presence of Arctic plants in Central
Europe and their bearing on the climatic problems are
discussed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br />

THE ORIENTAL MIGRATION.</h2>


<p>The Oriental migration is closely related to the
Siberian. Both have originated within the Asiatic
continent, and in many respects a strict line cannot
be drawn between them. There can be no doubt
that some of the species which we regard as Siberian
migrants had their original home in more southern
latitudes, and thus may have formed part of the
older Oriental migration. The home of that migration
I take to be Central and Southern Asia, that is
to say, everything south of the Altaï Mountains and
the Caucasus. Its members have reached Europe
across an old land-connection which united Turkey,
Greece, and Syria, while the Siberian animals invaded
our continent to the north of the Caspian and
Caucasus.</p>

<p>The Siberian immigrants into Europe on the whole
are not very numerous, but it is different with those
from the more southern parts of the Asiatic continent.
The members of the Oriental migration
form a very large percentage of the European fauna.
No other migration has affected our continent so
powerfully, because it continued uninterruptedly for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
a very long time. Hence its results can be traced
from one corner of Europe to the other. We have
seen that the Siberian migration only commenced
after the first portion of the Glacial period had passed
away. The Oriental, however, persisted throughout,
or at any rate for the greater part of that period. It
commenced ages before it, in miocene times, or even
earlier. And as the Ægean Sea, which broke up the
highway of the Oriental migrants, is only of recent
formation, there was a steady westward march for a
very considerable time. No doubt the migration was
also favoured by the fact that scarcely any formidable
barriers had to be crossed.</p>

<p>Many instances might be quoted of the same
species forming part of the Oriental and also of the
Siberian migration, but as a rule the Siberian migrant
belongs to a distinct variety, or has such well-marked
racial characters as to be at once detected
from its more southern relative. Among the examples
of Oriental migrants which I have occasion
to bring forward, such instances will be specially
dealt with.</p>

<p>In its wild state the Red Deer (<i>Cervus elaphus</i>) is
almost extinct in the British Islands, though it still
occurs in the moorlands of Devonshire and Somersetshire
in England, in the south-west of Ireland, and
in some localities in Scotland. Fifty years ago it was
also found wild in several other of the Irish western
counties; and in the seventeenth century it was
common in most of the mountainous districts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
Ireland. Its remains have been found fossil in the
marls and caves of Ireland, and in the Forest-Bed,
as well as in a large number of caves in England.
The history of the Red Deer in other countries
is very similar. In Scandinavia it flourished as
far north as the sixty-eighth degree of latitude,
whereas it is now quite extinct on the mainland,
though still lingering on in some of the
western islands. Denmark and Switzerland know
it no more, and it is almost extinct in Belgium.
Nearly throughout Europe where it occurs, its
numbers are diminishing, greatly owing, perhaps, to
the relentless persecution by man, but its gradual
disappearance must likewise be partly due to other
causes. Formerly it inhabited every country of
Europe and all the larger islands. It still exists
in Corsica and Sardinia, and at an earlier period
it was also met with on the island of Malta.
The Red Deer found in Corsica and Sardinia is
smaller than that inhabiting Central Europe, and is
by some authorities regarded as a distinct species,
which has been named <i>Cervus corsicanus</i>. But
Sir Victor Brooke has pointed out that the antlers
of some of the Scotch Deer agree in every point
with those of the Sardinian species. Indeed, the
West European Red Deer altogether is a small-antlered
form, compared with the Eastern one. This
character, however, is only a racial one, and not of
specific value. In the pleistocene deposits of Eastern
and Central Europe, a very large-antlered race has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
been discovered, and identified by Professor Nehring
with <i>Cervus canadensis</i>&mdash;the Canadian Red Deer.
Tcherski, the Siberian traveller, believed that <i>Cervus
canadensis</i> was identical with, or a variety of, the
Asiatic species of Deer, <i>Cervus eustephanus</i>, <i>Cervus
xanthopygus</i>, and <i>Cervus maral</i>. Some authorities&mdash;and
to these belong Mr. Lydekker&mdash;think that we
ought perhaps to regard the whole number of Red
Deer-like forms as local varieties of one widely-spread
species. Besides the deer already referred to,
the following belong to this same group:&mdash;<i>Cervus
cashmirianus</i>, <i>Cervus affinis</i>, <i>Cervus Roosvelti</i>, from
North America, and the North African <i>Cervus barbarus</i>.</p>

<p>The question now is, where have these varieties
originated? Or, if we go to the root of the matter,
where is the original home of their ancestors? Considering
that so many <i>Cervidæ</i> have been found in
French and English pliocene deposits, and that
remains of the Red Deer occur not only in the
English Forest-Bed, but have been found associated
with those of the Pigmy Hippopotamus in Malta,
it would only be reasonable to suppose that the
genus <i>Cervus</i> had originated in Europe. It might
also be argued with equal force that the Red Deer
had its birthplace in our continent. But when we
carefully study its present range this verdict cannot
be accepted. The view of the Asiatic origin of the
Red Deer, so ably maintained by Köppen, corresponds
far better with its present distribution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
especially if we look upon the Asiatic, North
American, and North African forms as varieties of
the same species.</p>

<p>If the Red Deer were of European origin, it must
have come into existence at a time when Malta was
part of the mainland, when North Africa and the
British Islands were connected with the continent of
Europe, and of course before the deposition of the
Forest-Bed. Such land-connections existed probably
during the Pliocene Epoch. Migrants would have
wandered from Europe into Asia. These would
have developed into larger races, which again
furnished emigrants for North America. The latter
crossed by the old land-connection which once joined
America and Asia at Behring's Straits. During
pleistocene times the large Siberian race would now
have re-migrated to the home of its ancestors in
Europe, for we find the remains only in Central
and Eastern Europe, indicating that an invasion of
the Red Deer from Asia must then have taken
place.</p>

<p>Against this view of the European origin of the
Red Deer, it may be urged that deer are known from
Indian as well as from European pliocene deposits,
and that a migration could have taken place from
the Oriental Region to Europe just as easily as
from the latter to Asia. The majority of the species
of the genus <i>Cervus</i> (in a wide sense), moreover,
are Asiatic, ranging to Borneo, Sumatra, and the
Philippine Islands, all of which islands have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
separated from the mainland for a considerable time.
Finally, the original home of a species, as we have
learned, generally corresponds with the centre of its
geographical range, and this lies in the case of the
Red Deer in Central Asia.</p>

<p>One of the highest authorities on the deer family,
Sir Victor Brooke, also was of opinion that the
<i>Cervidæ</i> originated in Asia, and from there spread
east and west. Of the two divisions into which true
deer are divided, viz., the <i>Plesiometacarpalia</i> and
the <i>Telemetacarpalia</i>, the former is almost confined to
the Old and the latter to the New World. The only
North American species belonging to the first
division is the Canadian Red Deer, which fact
clearly indicates its recent immigration to that
continent.</p>

<p>There were probably two distinct migrations of
the Red Deer into Europe. An older one coming
from Asia Minor into Greece, which stocked Sardinia,
Corsica, Malta, and North Africa in the first place,
when these were still connected with one another.
This same migration likewise affected western continental
Europe, the Irish Red Deer being probably
the descendant of this very ancient stock. The
latter entered the island when it was still part of the
Continent. The later migration of a larger form came
from Siberia and spread mainly over Eastern and
Central Europe, but it appears that it also reached
England, although there is no evidence of any of
these Siberian deer having ever inhabited Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p><p>The range of this deer, therefore, to some extent
corresponds to that of another described on p. <a href="#Page_153">153</a>.
We found then that two races of Reindeer had
migrated to the British Islands&mdash;one from the Arctic
Regions, and the other from Siberia, but that only
the former had reached Ireland.</p>

<p>The so-called Irish Elk (<i>Cervus giganteus</i>) has
been referred to the Oriental migration, but, as
stated below, it has some claims to be regarded
as a European. Unfortunately it is now extinct;
it seems not unlikely, however, that it inhabited
Ireland when man had already made his appearance
on the island. Although its remains are found
in such extraordinary abundance in Ireland, it
certainly did not originate there. It lived also
in England and Scotland, and in the Isle of Man,
in France, Denmark, Germany, Austria, North Italy,
and Russia. Its remains have been discovered
even in Siberia. It must either have originated
in Europe and then migrated to Asia, or have had its
birthplace in Asia and wandered to Europe. There
is nothing to lead any one to assert positively that
either of these two continents was the one in which
the original home of the Irish Elk was situated, and
we can only be guided in this case by the history of
its nearest relatives. These are the Fallow Deer
(<i>Cervus dama</i>). There are two very closely allied
species, the Persian and the European, but several
others have been discovered in the Forest-Bed and
the pliocene deposits of the Auvergne. As no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
remains of the Fallow Deer are known from Asia,
it seems probable that it and also the Irish Elk
originated in Southern Europe, and only invaded
Asia in early pleistocene times.</p>

<p>The Mammoth (<i>Elephas primigenius</i>) is a familiar
example among a large number of mammals which
have come to us about the same time from Asia by
the Asia Minor route. It had a much wider range
than the Irish Elk, since its remains have been discovered
in a large number of European localities as
far west as Ireland, also in Siberia, and even North
America. Though we have had <i>Proboscidea</i> in Europe
from the Middle Miocene onwards, Mr. Lydekker
(<i>d</i>, p. viii.) holds that "our comparatively full knowledge
of Lower Miocene and Upper Eocene mammalian
faunas of the greater part of Europe and
North America, renders it almost certain that neither
of those regions was the home of the direct ancestors
of the <i>Elephantidæ</i>; and we must therefore look
forward to the discovery of mammaliferous Lower
Miocene or Upper Eocene strata in some other
region of the (probably old) world which may yield
these missing forms."</p>

<p>The genus <i>Elephas</i> makes its first appearance in
the Upper Miocene of India. Our European <i>E.
antiquus</i> is, according to Professor Zittel, probably
identical with <i>E. armeniacus</i> of Asia Minor, while
<i>E. meridionalis</i> agrees in all essential characters
with the Indian <i>E. hysudricus</i>. The Indian and
European species of fossil elephants altogether are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
very closely related, and the supposition that they
all have had their original home in the Oriental Region
offers, I think, no serious obstacle. The view of the
European origin of the mammoth especially is open
to very serious objections. It does not occur in any
European pliocene deposits, and could not therefore
have originated in our Continent until pleistocene
times. That it should then have commenced its
travels through Europe and Siberia to the New
Siberian Islands and North America seems almost
an impossibility. But if we suppose the mammoth
to have had its home in India in pliocene times, it
could then easily have migrated to all the parts of
the world where its remains have been discovered.</p>

<p>Of the Asiatic mammals still living, some have
only just crossed the borders of Europe and then
died out again. Similar cases have been referred to
in discussing the Siberian migration. Thus remains
of the camel have been found in Roumania and in
Southern Russia in pleistocene deposits. Others have
lingered on to the present day. <i>Crocidura etrusca</i>,
for instance, still lives in Southern France, Italy,
Sicily, and North-western Africa. All its nearest
relations are typically Oriental species. In spite of
the fact that a <i>Crocidura</i> is known from French and
German miocene deposits, the general range of the
genus suggests an Oriental origin. In early Tertiary
times a section spread into African territory and
another eastward as far as the island of Timor. This
may possibly have happened in miocene times, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
a few species likewise found their way into Europe.
Many other mammals have wandered still farther
west, and now form an important percentage of the
European fauna.</p>

<p>Of Birds, too, a large number might be mentioned
which had their home in Asia and have found their
way to Europe with the Oriental migrants. A few
instances have already been alluded to, and some
additional ones may be specified at random, without
attempting to give a complete list.</p>

<p>Some of the Wagtails (<i>Motacilla</i>), as I mentioned
in the last chapter, have certainly come to
us with the Siberian migration; but others seem
to be Oriental, such as <i>Motacilla melanope</i>, which is
resident in Southern Europe and migratory in the
North. <i>M. campestris</i>&mdash;the Yellow Wagtail&mdash;has
a most peculiar discontinuous range. One colony
breeds in the British Isles and Western Europe
generally, where it is known as a summer visitor,
retiring to West Africa during winter; another is
found from South-east Russia to Turkestan in
summer, and winters in Southern Africa. This fact
may possibly be due to two distinct migrations from
Asia having taken place: an earlier one from the
South-east&mdash;that is to say, an Oriental one&mdash;and
a Siberian one more recently. In this case the
members of the two migrations have not become
sufficiently differentiated to be regarded as distinct
varieties. Though most of the Wagtails have a
somewhat northern range, none (except perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
<i>M. borealis</i>) are truly Arctic; and indeed, as almost all of
them pass the winter in southern latitudes, it may
be assumed that they are of southern and not of
northern origin.</p>

<p>The Dippers (<i>Cinclus</i>) are practically unknown in
the Central European plain, but they occur in
Western Europe as far north as Scandinavia, also
in the Alps, Carpathians, and Southern Europe, including
Sicily and Sardinia. Some authorities distinguish
three species, others only one. As a matter
of fact, the difference between the three forms is very
slight, and their nests and eggs are undistinguishable.
Eight other species have been recognised, and all
these are either Asiatic or American. As one of the
American forms is peculiar to Peru and another to
Ecuador and Columbia, and since the genus as a
whole is a mountain-genus, it probably is an ancient
one. Its European range alone, however, implies that
it has inhabited our continent for a considerable
time and is no new-comer. We may look upon it as
of Asiatic origin. The ancestors have spread east
and west, the European species having arrived with
the earlier Oriental migrants, and wandered along
the Mediterranean at a time when the geographical
conditions of that sea were vastly different from what
they are to-day.</p>

<p>Not quite so ancient as the Dippers, but likewise
Asiatic in their origin, are the Bullfinches
(<i>Pyrrhula</i>). The closely allied Pine-Grosbeak (<i>Pinicola
enucleator</i>) has already been referred to (p. <a href="#Page_191">191</a>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
as a member of the Siberian migration. The
distribution of the European Bullfinch (<i>P. europæa</i>)
is very interesting, as it occurs in two distinct
forms, by some authorities regarded as races, by
others as species. In all probability these two
races owe their origin to two different migrations
from the same ancestral stock. We may suppose
that <i>P. europæa</i> came to Europe along with the
Oriental migration, spreading chiefly over the south
and west, while another branch developed in Siberia
into the larger and more brilliant race (<i>P. major</i>),
which subsequently entered the neighbouring continent
with the Siberian fauna. The latter race
inhabits, according to Mr. Saunders, Northern and
Eastern Europe, and also Siberia. All the other
species&mdash;there are eight more&mdash;except one, are found
in Asia. This one species, which inhabits the Azores,
appears to be more closely related to one of the
Siberian bullfinches than to the European. It stands
isolated, and is an extraordinary instance of discontinuous
distribution, as no Bullfinch inhabits either
Madeira or the Canary Islands. We must assume
that the form connecting it with the Asiatic probably
lived in Southern Europe, and has become
extinct.</p>

<p>One of the most typically Oriental genera of birds
is <i>Phasianus</i>, to which our Common Pheasant belongs.
Out of twenty species, nineteen are found exclusively
in Asia, most of them being confined to the central
plateaux of that continent. Only one species passes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
the confines of Asia into Greece, Turkey, and
Southern Russia. This is <i>Phasianus colchicus</i>. Formerly,
however, the Pheasant appears to have had a
wider range in Europe, for three species are known
fossil from France. Altogether, it is not quite certain
whether the Pheasant is not really an indigenous bird
in the British Islands, having survived from pre-glacial
times. It is believed that the Romans brought
it to England, but there is no record of an introduction
at that time.</p>

<p>Among the older Oriental bird migrants might be
mentioned the Fire-crested Wren (<i>Regulus ignicapillus</i>),
which has even occasionally visited England. It becomes
commoner as we go south-eastward. In Asia
Minor it is more abundant than the Gold-crest; and
throughout the year it is resident in Southern Europe,
where it occurs in Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain,
Sardinia, and Malta. On the opposite shore, in
North-west Africa, it again makes its appearance,
and its range extends westward to the Canaries (<i>R.
teneriffæ</i>) and Madeira (<i>R. maderensis</i>).</p>

<p>The genus to which our common Goldfinch belongs,
viz., <i>Carduelis</i>, is also probably of Oriental origin, and
may be looked upon as one of the earlier migrants.
That species (<i>C. elegans</i>) breeds throughout Europe,
except in the extreme north, but it is especially
abundant in Southern Europe and North-west Africa.
It is also resident in Madeira and the Canaries.
Eastward its range extends to Persia. A larger
race (<i>C. major</i>) inhabits Western Siberia and crosses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
the European border into Russia. It interbreeds
in Siberia with <i>C. caniceps</i>, an East Siberian
form.</p>

<p>A few instances of Reptiles and Amphibia with a
similar range will show that the Oriental migration
was not confined to the higher vertebrates.</p>

<p>Two species of the genus <i>Eremias</i> (<i>Podarcis</i>) occur
in South-eastern Europe. This is a genus of Lizards
with rather a wide distribution, ranging from Central
Asia to South Africa southward and China eastward.
Altogether there are twenty-four species, two of which
just enter Europe; and of the rest half are Asiatic
and half African. Even if the genus were of African
origin, it is extremely unlikely that the Asiatic
species came by way of Europe. We may assume,
therefore, with a fair degree of probability that the
two European species wandered westward along with
the Oriental migrants.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Ablepharus</i> belongs to a family of
Lizards in which the legs are either very fully
developed, or quite absent as in the Slow-worm
(<i>Anguis fragilis</i>). It is an ancient genus, having a
wide range from Central Asia to Australia on the one
hand, and to South Africa on the other. One species
of this Scink-like Lizard, viz., <i>Ablepharus pannonicus</i>,
enters Europe in the south-east, inhabiting Greece as
far north as Southern Hungary. In Asia it is found
in Syria and North Arabia. This clearly signifies
that the Lizard is an Oriental migrant.</p>

<p>Among the Snakes which participated in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Oriental migration might be mentioned <i>Eryx jaculus</i>,
whose home is probably in Western Asia. It is
known in Europe from the Greek islands of Tinos
and Naxos, from Turkey and Southern Russia.
Another, a peculiar worm-like form, lives underground
in damp earth and under stones&mdash;<i>Typhlops
lumbricalis</i>. This species inhabits the mainland of
Greece as well as the Greek islands, and Asia Minor
as far as the Caucasus.</p>

<p>A most interesting case of distribution is that of
the pretty little Toad so well known on the Continent
under the name of "fire-toad" (<i>Bombinator igneus</i>).
Though some authorities, such as Boulenger, recognise
only one form of <i>Bombinator</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_10" id="FNanchor_1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_10" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> others are of
opinion that two well-marked varieties exist in
Europe. These are looked upon by Dr. von Bedriaga
as good species, but he acknowledges that they are
rather critical and difficult to identify. No other
species of <i>Bombinator</i> occur in Europe. <i>Bombinator
pachypus</i>, the western race,&mdash;or if we choose to call it
species,&mdash;occurs in France, Germany, Switzerland,
Austria, Sicily, and Greece. <i>B. igneus</i>&mdash;the eastern
race&mdash;is found in Southern Sweden, Denmark, Germany,
Austria, and Russia. The latter has therefore
a more northerly and easterly range. The species is
not known from Siberia, but makes its appearance
again in China in a form which, according to Dr. von<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Bedriaga, does not quite agree with either of the two
European races.</p>

<p>Now if we supposed <i>Bombinator</i> to have originated
in Europe, its absence from the British Islands, most
of the Mediterranean islands, and the greater part
of Scandinavia would not be easy of explanation,
while as an Asiatic migrant the European range is
more readily understood. Its apparent absence from
Western Asia might quite likely be due to the fact
that the zoology of that part of the Continent is only
now being investigated. The latter has, moreover,
undergone great physical changes in recent geological
times. The supposition that one migration of <i>Bombinator</i>
from the south-east has taken place, and
then another from the east, seems to explain this
case of distribution, as other similar ones, in a most
satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>The Tree-Frog (<i>Hyla arborea</i>) must be an ancient
species, but it is not of European origin. Few genera
of Amphibia have a wider distribution than <i>Hyla</i>.
There are only three species in Asia, Europe, and
Africa, the remaining 129 being confined to America
and Australia. Two of the three Old World Tree-frogs
are so closely allied that until recently they
were regarded as mere varieties of one another.
These are <i>Hyla arborea</i> and <i>H. chinensis</i>. The
former is found in Asia Minor, Persia, China and
Japan, and in most of the Mediterranean islands and
Southern Europe generally. It does not occur in the
British Islands, Norway, or North Russia, but in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
South Sweden, Germany, France, and Spain. It is
also known from North Africa and from Madeira, the
Canaries, and the Salvages. The occurrence of the
Tree-Frog on so many of the Mediterranean islands
is of particular interest, especially as four well-marked
varieties have been distinguished by our leading herpetologists,
so that the more minute features of the
various forms can be traced from island to island,
adding one more proof&mdash;if proof were needed&mdash;of
their former continuity. Of course, that <i>Hyla arborea</i>
must be considered an Oriental migrant seems so
evident that it scarcely needs further comment.</p>

<p>A number of mollusca might be mentioned whose
range indicates that they have migrated to Europe
from Asia Minor. <i>Buliminus pupa</i> is one of these.
It is known from Asia Minor, Greece, South Italy,
Sicily, and Algeria. <i>Buliminus detritus</i> is perhaps
better known, being common in some parts of
Germany. From there its range spreads east as
far as Asia Minor. Many closely allied species
inhabit Western Asia, to which they are confined,
while others enter on European territory in some
of the Greek islands. <i>B. fasciolatus</i> occurs on the
islands of Crete, Rhodes, Cyprus, and in Greece
and Syria. Most of the species of <i>Buliminus</i> have
a very restricted range, but <i>Buliminus obscurus</i> is
found almost all over Europe, from Ireland in the
west to the Crimea and Transcaucasia in the east.</p>

<p>Whether the sub-genus <i>Pomatia</i> of the genus
<i>Helix</i>&mdash;to which the so-called Roman Snail belongs&mdash;is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>of Asiatic origin, or whether some of the species
have migrated from Europe to Asia, I am not prepared
to say; but there can be no doubt that <i>Helix
pomatia</i> has reached Western Europe from the east.</p>

<p>On the whole, the number of mollusca which we
might point to as having migrated to Europe is not
large, the great majority being indigenous to our
continent. However, some of the other groups of
invertebrates differ very materially in that respect
from the mollusca. I cannot leave the consideration
of the mollusca without referring to the fact that
there appears to be a very important centre of
distribution in South-eastern Europe. It is from
this centre that many species have spread north
and south, east and west. Take, for example, the
genus <i>Clausilia</i>, a small land-shell shaped like a
pointed round tower, and abundant on old walls
and tree trunks. In England we have four species
of <i>Clausilia</i>, in Ireland only two. In the greater
part of Spain only our common <i>Cl. bidentata</i> occurs.
As we go east the number of species rapidly
increases. A maximum is reached in South-eastern
Europe, where hundreds of different kinds are found.
Towards Northern Europe a similar decrease of
species takes place. So far the history of the
<i>Clausiliæ</i> seems perfectly simple. An active centre
of origin appears to exist in South-eastern Europe,
from which the species radiate out in all directions.
But when we come to look more closely into the
extra-European distribution of the genus, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
especially when we examine its past history, we
find that its origin is extremely complex, and dates
back to a much more remote period than would
have been imagined, had we merely taken into
account its present range in our own continent.
Professor Boettger, who is the highest authority on
<i>Clausilia</i>, tells us that the genus is known from
the earliest deposits of the Tertiary Era. About
700 species are now known, and these have
been sub-divided by Professor Boettger and others
into a number of sub-genera. Some of these are
extinct, but the great majority are still living.
The sub-genus <i>Phædusa</i> occurs in the eocene
and oligocene of Southern Europe, but it is extinct
as far as our continent is concerned. Close upon
a hundred species, however, still inhabit India,
the Malayan Islands, China, Ceylon, and Japan.
Then again, the sub-genus <i>Laminifera</i> occurs in the
oligocene and miocene of Central Europe, and
survives in a single species, <i>Cl. Pauli</i>, in South-western
France. The groups <i>Garnieria</i> of China,
<i>Macroptychia</i> of East Africa, <i>Boettgeria</i> of Madeira,
and <i>Nenia</i> of South America, have no fossil representatives.
We have here some very remarkable
cases of discontinuous distribution which testify to
the antiquity of the genus, and this is certainly
confirmed by the fossil evidence. However, it is
hardly likely that the headquarters, as it were, of
<i>Clausilia</i> have always been in South-eastern Europe.
Most of that part of the Continent has been submerged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>since eocene times more than once. The
peculiar distribution of the genus might be explained,
I think, if we supposed the original home of <i>Clausilia</i>
to have been in Southern Asia, that from this centre
Southern Europe was colonised, where a new centre
developed in oligocene and miocene times, sending
colonies off to Madeira and across the old land-connection
which united Northern Africa and South
America about that time. The most active centre
of development then gradually shifted eastward
again, while the older centres were perhaps submerged
during the physical changes in the distribution
of land and water.</p>

<p>I should have mentioned that the species
wandering westward and northward from this
South-European centre of distribution, would
naturally have joined the migrants which came
from beyond the borders of our continent. They
might thus appear to be true Oriental migrants,
and on a previous occasion I grouped all these
together under the term of "Southern Fauna," as
I assumed the observer to be stationed in the
British Islands. All new-comers from the south-east,
south, or south-west of Europe would be to
him southerners quite irrespective of their original
home, which might be in Southern Europe, Asia,
or Africa.</p>

<p>The Swallow-tail is well known to all collectors
of Butterflies in England, though it has of late
years become very rare and is now confined to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
few localities in the east of England. The members
of the family <i>Papilionidæ</i>, to which it belongs, are
mostly large and striking species, and their distribution
is therefore more accurately known than
that of the smaller and less conspicuous butterflies.
Only four different kinds of Swallow-tail Butterflies
inhabit Europe, but in Southern Asia and the Malay
peninsula they attain their maximum as regards
numbers; and there we find a great many species of
this genus <i>Papilio</i>. Of the four European species only
one, viz., <i>Papilio hospiton</i>, is peculiar to Europe; all
the others range into Asia. It would seem, therefore,
as if this genus was an Asiatic one and had migrated
to Europe, and that the route taken was the one from
Asia Minor across to Greece. We have a similar
case in the closely allied genus <i>Thais</i> two of the
three European species living also in Asia Minor.
<i>Thais cerisyi</i> inhabits some of the Greek islands, as
well as the mainland of Turkey and Greece.</p>

<p>Another genus of the great family <i>Papilionidæ</i>
with which most lepidopterists are well acquainted
is <i>Parnassius</i>. What butterfly-hunter has been in
Switzerland without hearing of, or seeing, the famous
<i>Parnassius Apollo</i>? We have four European species of
<i>Parnassius</i>, only one of which is peculiar to our continent,
but the locality where it occurs, the Caucasus,
is on the borders of Asia. Almost all the other
species are Asiatic, none however range to the south.
Its headquarters, and I think its original home, are
the mountains of Central Asia. From there it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
has spread&mdash;some species to the Himalayas, and
a few to Europe and North America. But these
migrations are not of very recent date. <i>Parnassius</i>
no doubt arrived accompanied by a large number
of other Central Asiatic mountain insects and
plants. I shall refer to the latter again when
dealing with the origin of the Alpine fauna, but
meanwhile it might be mentioned that the famous
Swiss "Edelweiss" (<i>Leontopodium alpinum</i>), which
we are accustomed to regard as a typical Alpine
plant, is certainly of Asiatic origin. In some parts
of Southern Siberia it is one of the common meadow-flowers,
and ranges from there south into Kashmere,
but not northward. Like the <i>Apollo</i>, it does not
occur in Scandinavia or Northern Siberia. Both
plant and insect evidently migrated from Central
Asia, directly westward along the southern border of
the sea, which extended from that region as far as
the European Alps in early Tertiary times. At that
time the Caucasus was possibly still connected with
the Balkan Mountains, across what is now the Black
Sea, and that may have been the highway on which
they travelled west.</p>

<p>Some of the Clouded-Yellows&mdash;butterflies appertaining
to the genus <i>Colias</i>&mdash;formed part of the
Oriental migration. The genus is undoubtedly of
Asiatic origin, and while many of the species have
turned northward, ranging across Siberia and North
America, others have taken a southern and westward
turn and thus reached Europe. We have two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
Clouded-Yellows in Western Europe, and both of
them must have come with this migration.</p>

<p>A very good example of an Oriental migrant is
<i>Danais chrysippus</i>, a magnificent butterfly found in
Greece and Southern Italy. In Asia it is known from
Syria, Persia, and from the whole of the southern
portion of the Continent. The genus <i>Danais</i> (in
its wide sense) is a large one, and principally
occurs in the warmer regions of Asia. Three
species are found in North America and only one in
Europe.</p>

<p>Among the beetles belonging to this migration,
there is one of very considerable interest from a distributional
point of view, for all the species of the
genus&mdash;even the whole family to which the genus
belongs&mdash;are what is known by zoologists as "Commensalists."
These are animals habitually associating
and living in close connection with others with which
they are not tied by any family relations or kinship.
Such a state of close and permanent friendship is
called "commensalism." Now it appears as if the
members of this family of beetles (<i>Clavigeridæ</i>) had of
their own free will formed such a close connection
with colonies of ants&mdash;sometimes with one species,
sometimes another. They are the permanent guests
of the ants, and in return they secrete a fluid which is
apparently highly prized by them. All of the <i>Clavigers</i>
are provided with peculiar club-shaped antennæ,
with which they ungraciously beat their hosts, when
they are in want of food. According to some authorities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>they even occasionally gnaw at the pupæ and
larvæ of the ant with which they live.</p>

<p>Such beetles naturally can only have extremely
limited means of distribution, and they are comparable
in that respect with the woodlice of the genus
<i>Platyarthrus</i>, to which I have already had occasion
to refer. All the species of <i>Claviger</i> are confined to
Europe, chiefly to the south, but one species, <i>Cl.
testaceus</i>, has wandered farther north and occurs in
the nest of the ant <i>Lasius flavus</i> in the south of
England, Ireland, and Scotland. Though none of the
<i>Clavigers</i> can be claimed as Oriental migrants, the
centre of distribution of the genera belonging to the
<i>Clavigeridæ</i> is in Southern Asia, and it is probable
that the ancestors of the European <i>Clavigers</i> have
spread westward from that region to Europe, eastward
to Australia and Japan, and southward to Madagascar
and South Africa. The genus <i>Hopatroides</i>, belonging
to the same family as the so-called Spanish-fly (<i>Tenebrionidæ</i>),
has twelve species in Western Asia and
Greece. One only, <i>H. thoracicus</i>&mdash;an instance of discontinuous
distribution&mdash;occurs in Andalusia. <i>Amphicoma</i>
is represented in Western Asia and the Balkan
peninsula by fifteen species, while three others are
met with in North-west Africa and Southern Spain.</p>

<p>A genus of Dragon-fly, <i>Onychogomphus</i>, has in
Europe a somewhat similar distribution to <i>Claviger</i>,
but it has besides a very extensive foreign range.
There are altogether thirty-five species; of these ten
are Holarctic, twelve Oriental, five Mascarene, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
eight Ethiopian. The centre of distribution is therefore
in the Oriental region, and we may assume that
in all probability the genus has originated there,
the European species having travelled west with
the Oriental migration at an early date of the
Tertiary Era.</p>

<p><i>Ryothemis</i>, another genus of Dragon-flies, has
originated perhaps somewhat farther east than the
last, for no less than thirteen species are found
in Australia, a like number in India, five in Madagascar
and Africa, and five in the Holarctic region.
Both of these genera are entirely absent from
America, and they have possibly travelled to Europe
together.</p>

<p>Among the European <i>Orthoptera</i>&mdash;the group to
which our Earwigs and Grasshoppers belong&mdash;there
are also a good many instances of Oriental migrants.
One of the most striking of these is the curious
"praying insect" (<i>Mantis religiosa</i>). It occurs all
over Southern Europe, and ranges as far north as the
north of France. It is also found in Southern Germany
and in Austria, and has a vast extra-European
range. There are even records of its occurrence from
all parts of Southern Asia and Java and a great part
of Africa. That it belongs to an extremely ancient
genus is testified by the fact of its presence in
Mauritius, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, South
America, and Madagascar. The genus <i>Bacillus</i>&mdash;to
which the typical Stick-insects belong&mdash;has a somewhat
similar geographical distribution. But no less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
than four species of <i>Bacillus</i> are known from Europe,
according to our great authority Mr. Brunner von
Wattenwyl&mdash;all from the south; and some of these
also range into North Africa. There are thirty-two
other species distributed over Southern Asia, Africa,
Australia, New Zealand, and the Sandwich Islands.</p>

<p>Volumes, indeed, might be filled with lists of
species and genera of terrestrial invertebrates of
Oriental origin, but I will not weary the reader
with further enumeration of such instances. Just
two more, however, before concluding, as I have
not alluded to the large group of the <i>Arachnida</i>.</p>

<p>Two peculiar spider-like genera, viz., <i>Galeodes</i> and
<i>Rhax</i>, are found in Southern Europe. Both occur
also in North Africa, and in Western and a portion of
Southern Asia. As the whole family altogether has
an Asiatic character, I cannot agree with Mr. Pocock,
who considers them of European origin and believes
that they are migrating eastward.</p>

<p>But not only terrestrial forms migrated to Europe
from Western and Southern Asia. Freshwater
species also took part in this great Oriental migration.
I need only refer to the freshwater Crab
(<i>Thelphusa fluviatilis</i>), with which Southern Europeans
are familiar. It is the sole representative of a
large genus which ranges east as far as Australia and
southward to Madagascar and the Cape of Good
Hope. The European species is found in Turkey,
Cyprus, Greece, Southern Italy, Sicily, North Africa,
Southern Spain, Syria, and Persia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p><p>There is a corresponding flora with a range exactly
similar to that of some of the animals quoted. Thus
the Balkan Rhododendron (<i>Rhododendron ponticum</i>)
is again met with in the western Mediterranean
region in Southern Spain. The Cedar occurs in
local varieties in the Himalayan Mountains, in the
Lebanon, and the Atlas Mountains. Both of these
are instances of discontinuous distribution, a proof of
their antiquity; but a large number of plants have a
continuous range between Asia Minor and Spain.</p>

<p>On looking through these few instances of what have
been called Oriental migrants, one cannot help being
struck by the fact that the species after their entry
into Europe evidently did not all follow the same path
during their westward advance. We have seen that
a good many seem to have travelled either due west
or north-west on entering our continent from Asia
Minor. They may now perhaps be found in Greece,
Southern Italy, Algiers, and Spain, also probably on
some of the intervening islands in the Greek Archipelago,
in Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica, or they may have
travelled north-east and occur in the Alps. This distribution
indicates undoubtedly, as I have already set forth
in another memoir (<i>c</i>, p. 459), that land extended from
Asia Minor across Greece to Southern Italy, that the
latter again was disconnected with Central Italy, but
united with Sicily, Sardinia, and Tunis, and that the
Straits of Gibraltar did not exist at the time when
these species migrated westward. Some species
are only to be found as far west as Southern Italy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
while others occur in Central and Northern Europe,
scarcely in the South, and not at all in the
larger Mediterranean islands or in North Africa.
This appears to me to indicate that the late comers
from the east found that geographical changes had
taken place in Southern Europe which prevented
them from following the same track as the older
immigrants. They were now obliged to turn directly
northward and then westward. It may be asked,
why should not the earlier migrants have taken the
same route? This question will be answered immediately.
Meanwhile it should be clearly understood
that there probably was an older and a newer migration
from the east. The Oriental genera&mdash;from
whose general range we know that they must be
very ancient indeed, such as <i>Mantis</i> and <i>Bacillus</i>&mdash;are
almost invariably confined to Southern Europe.
There they are frequently found on some of the
Mediterranean islands. The earlier migrants therefore
went westward and the later ones northward.</p>

<p>Let us now inquire a little into the reasons why
such different courses were pursued by the migrants&mdash;why
the Oriental migration divided into two
streams, an older and a newer.</p>

<p>During early Tertiary times, and probably throughout
the Miocene and Pliocene Epochs, the Ægean
Sea did not exist. From the island of Crete to the
Peloponnesus, and from Asia Minor to Thessaly
and Macedonia, stretched a vast and fertile plain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
dotted over with numerous freshwater lakes. Gradually
the sea encroached upon this land from the
south, owing chiefly to extensive subsidences having
taken place. Only very recently, says Professor
Suess, did the whole of the Ægean continent subside
(i., p. 437). Huge cliffs of levantine freshwater
deposits now mark the new coast-line, and the Mediterranean
advances steadily towards the Black Sea
and the Sea of Asov. A new order of things is now
established, continues the famous author of <i>Das
Antlitz der Erde</i>; where there were high mountains
we now behold a deep sea, in some places many
thousand feet deep. All this took place quite
recently,&mdash;geologically speaking,&mdash;certainly in post-glacial
times; and man may even have witnessed
these imposing events. Most geologists admit the
correctness of these views. They are, moreover,
built upon such solid geological evidence, that even
if the science of zoogeography had not yet taught us
anything, naturalists would not hesitate in accepting
them.</p>

<p>Animals and plants were free to migrate from
Central and Southern Asia to Greece by land for
untold ages. The vast accumulation of mammalian
bones which have been discovered at Pikermi, and so
ably described by Gaudry, are probably to a large
extent the remains of Asiatic immigrants to Europe.
Many of these resemble forms still living in South
Africa, which implies that a highway existed also at
that time between Asia and Africa. Among these is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
a giraffe and antelopes closely allied to African
species, and other most interesting mammals.</p>

<p>In still earlier European deposits&mdash;the Miocene&mdash;we
find the ancestors of modern Elephants, which
are probably of Asiatic origin. The remains of
several kinds of monkeys occur, whose nearest
relations are now confined to Southern Asia.
Altogether the fauna bears a strong Asiatic facies.
Many of our European terrestrial invertebrates
probably arrived about this time from Asia. The
struggle for existence being keener and the facility
for migration much greater in the higher vertebrates,
they&mdash;or at any rate the mammalian faunas&mdash;were
subjected to more rapid changes than the invertebrates.
I have repeatedly expressed my belief that
a great number of our familiar insects and mollusca
inhabited Europe long before our present mammals
came into existence.<a name="FNanchor_2_11" id="FNanchor_2_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_11" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Let us now follow one of the miocene Oriental
migrants starting from Central Asia on its way to
Europe. Very soon after leaving its home, it must
have encountered a sea which extended at that time
from the Eastern Mediterranean to the borders of
Afghanistan. In following a westward course, the
emigrant was compelled to keep along the northern
shore of it. We do not know the state of the
physical geography of the region between the Black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
Sea and the Tianshan Mountains, but it seems
certain that a considerable extent of dry land
enabled a wanderer from Central or Southern Asia
to reach the Balkan peninsula by skirting the
northern shore of that large miocene sea. No
miocene deposits occur north of Teheran or of the
Upper Euphrates, nor are they known from the
islands of the Ægean Sea or the lands surrounding it.
From the Balkan peninsula it was possible for our
migrant to reach the European Alps, which were
then slowly rising as a peninsula out of the western
portion of the great miocene sea. What are now
the Alps was then hilly ground, which was being
raised from the bottom of the sea. It was no doubt
connected with the Balkan peninsula, so that an
intercourse of species could take place between this
newly-formed peninsula and Central Asia. I say
peninsula, because the miocene sea almost completely
surrounded it. From the Western Mediterranean a
wide gulf extended up the Rhone valley into that of
the Rhine as far north as Maintz. Then skirting along
the northern outliers of the Tyrol, the gulf can be
followed as far east as Transylvania. It is quite
probable that it extended much farther east still, but
there is as yet no geological evidence forthcoming.
At any rate, our Asiatic migrant turning northward
from the Balkan peninsula found its farther progress
barred once more by an arm of the same sea which in
its earlier peregrinations had stopped it from going
south (cf. Suess, i., p. 406).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p><p>In later miocene times the sea does not seem to
have surrounded the Alps to the same extent as it
did before, but it certainly extended from the Eastern
Alps to the shores of the Sea of Asov, so that the
direct northward passage was still more or less barred
to the Oriental immigrants. At the same time Alpine
species were now able to emigrate to the North
European provinces. During the last stages of this
epoch, the same sea increased its area very considerably
in an eastward direction. One continuous
expanse of water now stretched from the Alps as
far as the Sea of Aral in Central Asia, perhaps even
farther.</p>

<p>During pliocene times especially, the northern parts
of the Balkan peninsula were occupied by a series of
freshwater lakes, while Greece was joined to Southern
Italy, Sicily, and Tunis. Central and Northern Italy
were represented by a long narrow peninsula connected
in the north with the Alps. Corsica and
Sardinia were joined to Sicily, and the Straits of
Gibraltar did not exist. When I first published my
views regarding these geographical conditions of the
Mediterranean area, Professor Depéret was good
enough to send me his criticisms from a purely
geological standpoint. He is of opinion that though
Sicily and Sardinia might at this time have still been
connected with Tunis, the Straits of Messina must
already have been formed&mdash;in other words, Southern
Italy and Sicily could no longer have been connected
with one another. This opinion is based upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
fact that in the upper strata of the enormously thick
Sicilian pliocene deposits are found a number of
arctic or subarctic species of mollusca which are
entirely foreign to the Mediterranean fauna. It is
generally supposed that these reached the Mediterranean
area by the newly opened Straits of Gibraltar
in later pliocene times, and that the lower Sicilian
deposits must therefore have been laid down earlier.
So far the deductions are perfectly correct, if we assume
the northern mollusca to have arrived in the Atlantic
at the time stated. However, they must have reached
the Atlantic much later&mdash;not till pleistocene times&mdash;if
we adopt the above-stated suggestions as to the
age of the Forest-Bed (cf. p. <a href="#Page_125">125</a>). Moreover, the
great similarity between the faunas of Southern
Spain and North-western Africa indicate that the
formation of the Straits of Gibraltar is of very
recent date. The northern mollusca, of course,
could not have reached Sicily till later. To suppose
that the Sicilian deposits have been uplifted 7000 feet
since then is no doubt contrary to all our geological
teaching, but we must remember that this is altogether
an exceptional case. The area in question has probably
ever since been in the immediate neighbourhood
of an active volcano, and the rate of the uplift has
therefore been immeasurably greater than at other
localities with which this one might be compared. The
disconnection between Tunis, Sicily, and Southern
Italy was evidently produced by a subsidence of the
tract of land uniting these countries. If we suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
that this happened in early pliocene times, we have
either to take for granted that the terrestrial fauna
and flora of these countries are of miocene origin, or
that they were joined again during the Pleistocene
Epoch. The range of a very large number of animals
and plants is such as can only be explained by
assuming that Tunis, Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, and
Southern Italy were connected with one another. Of
such extensive land-connections subsequent to the
arrival of the northern marine mollusca we possess,
however, no geological evidence whatsoever; and it is
extremely improbable that the land-areas which had
sunk were once more raised before again subsiding.
The many animals whose presence in the Mediterranean
Region bears witness to these ancient land-connections
could not have arrived there in miocene
times&mdash;in fact, they could hardly have lived there
before the end of the Pliocene Epoch. On the other
hand, it seems difficult to believe, once the Straits of
Gibraltar were open and the waters of the Atlantic
able to enter the Mediterranean, that the sunken
parts between Sicily, Italy, and Tunis could have
been raised without affecting the entire area of that
sea. Nor is it likely that the junction between these
countries could have then been brought about by a
general lowering of the Mediterranean waters. As it
may be asked what evidences we possess at all for
the supposition of such land-connections as I have
indicated, also that Southern Italy and Greece
were connected, a few of the more salient instances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
of distribution bearing on this problem may be of
interest.</p>

<p>I have already referred to the occurrence of the
remains of a small race of Red Deer in the caves
of Malta, similar to those still living in North-west
Africa, Corsica, and Sardinia. The Black-mouthed
Weasel (<i>Mustela boccamela</i>) inhabits Persia,
Asia Minor, Greece, South Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia,
while <i>Mustela africana</i> is found in Malta and Algiers.
The European Porcupine inhabits Asia Minor, the
island of Rhodos, Greece, Southern Italy, Sicily,
North Africa, and Spain. Then we have the Wild
Sheep of Asia Minor, Cyprus, Sardinia, and Corsica,
all of which are closely allied. The small shrew-like
<i>Crocidura etrusca</i> occurs in South France, Italy,
Sicily, and North Africa. Many other mammalia
might be quoted, but these are sufficient for our
purpose.</p>

<p>There are a good many reptiles and amphibians
with a similar distribution. The European Chamæleon
(<i>Chamæleon vulgaris</i>) has been found in South Spain,
North Africa, and Sicily. The Snake <i>Periops hippocrepis</i>
is confined to Spain, Sardinia, and Greece.
The worm-like Lizard <i>Blanus cinereus</i> inhabits some
of the Greek islands, North Africa, and Spain.
Another Lizard belonging to the <i>Scincidæ</i> has also
been found in some of the Greek islands, Sicily,
Sardinia, Southern Spain, and the Canary Islands.
<i>Discoglossus pictus</i>&mdash;a toad&mdash;occurs in Spain, North-west
Africa, Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
A variety of the Tree Frog (<i>Hyla arborea Savignyi</i>)
is found in Europe only in Corsica, Sardinia, and the
Greek Archipelago.</p>

<p>Eight species of Reptiles and Amphibia&mdash;some of
which I have just referred to&mdash;are enumerated by Dr.
Forsyth Major as occurring eastward and westward
of the Italian peninsula (and almost all also in North
Africa) without being known on the mainland of Italy.
And in order to show that Sardinia and Corsica are
more closely related to North Africa than to Italy,
he indicates the general range of the Reptiles and
Amphibians found in these islands. Of the twenty-one
species, only twelve inhabit Italy, but at least
sixteen North Africa and seventeen Spain. Indeed,
he shows that Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, and North-west
Africa form a zoogeographical province, from
which Italy, with the exception of a few localities
on its west coast, is excluded. It is a remarkable
fact that there are a few localities on the west
coast of Italy which in their fauna and flora
exhibit closer relationship with Corsica and Sardinia
than with the mainland. Thus Dr. Major
pointed out that the <i>Catena Mettalifera</i>, the <i>Monte
Argentario</i>, and <i>Monte Circeo</i> all belong to what
we may call the former Tyrrhenian continent.
They are to be regarded as its eastern limits, which
remained standing, while the central portion&mdash;now
occupied by the Tyrrhenian Sea&mdash;subsided, and is
at present covered by deep sea. Subsequently these
remnants of the old continent became joined with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the newly-formed Italian peninsula, but the plants
and animals belonging to the older flora and fauna
were mostly destroyed by newer and more vigorous
immigrants. A few of the more hardy ones survived,
and are a standing testimony of the geographical
revolutions of that part of Southern Europe.</p>

<p>That the Mediterranean area has undergone such
profound geographical changes as I have endeavoured
to indicate is no new theory. Many zoologists who
have investigated the fauna of that region, and have
attempted to explain the faunistic relations, had to
acknowledge that the migrations must have taken
place under geographical conditions entirely different
from those obtaining at present. Rütimeyer long
ago remarked that it seemed to him much more
probable that Morocco, Algeria, and Tunis were
peopled by way of Gibraltar, and perhaps also by
Sicily and Malta from Europe, than Southern
Europe from Africa. After careful conchological
researches in the Western Mediterranean region,
Dr. Kobelt came to the conclusion that formerly
Southern Spain and Morocco must have been
united by a broad land-connection. Sicily and
Algeria do not apparently show any very intimate
relationship conchologically, but farther west&mdash;in the
mountains of Tetuan&mdash;Dr. Kobelt discovered a colony
of Sicilian forms.<a name="FNanchor_3_12" id="FNanchor_3_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_12" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p><p>"The close relationship," remarks Dr. Major (<i>a</i>,
p. 106), "shown in the fauna of Corsica and Sardinia
to Africa, permits the supposition that the connection
with these islands had persisted to a much more
recent date than that with Europe."</p>

<p>Many other authors have pointed out the close
similarity existing between the faunas of Southern
Europe and North Africa. We need only refer to
the writings of Professor Suess, Milne-Edwards, and
Boyd Dawkins. Mr. Blanchard went even so far as
to say, "a comparer les plantes et les animaux de la
Sicile et de la Tunésie, on se croirait sur le même
terrain" (p. 1047).</p>

<p>No less than 113 species of phanerogamic plants
are enumerated by Professor Engler (p. 53) as occurring
in the Mediterranean coast region east and west
of Italy without being found in that peninsula, or at
least only in the extreme south of it. But he tells us
that these species represent only a portion of such
plants, which are extremely numerous.</p>

<p>In taking a general survey of these plants, Professor
Engler is of opinion that their range implies
that a large number of the Mediterranean species
have migrated along a line which can be drawn
between North Africa, Sicily, Greece, Crete, and Asia
Minor, and that from this line the distribution started
northward again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p><p>Many of these plants then, and also some of the
animals I have referred to, formed part of the older
stream of migration which entered Europe from Asia
Minor (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Figure05">Fig. 5</a>, p. <a href="#Page_117">117</a>). There were only two
courses open to them as they arrived on our continent
during earlier Tertiary times. They could either go
straight west towards Greece, or in a more northward
direction to the newly-formed Alps. As the latter
were raised, some of the immigrants were modified
so as to adapt themselves to the new surroundings.
Others became extinct; but a great many have persisted
in the Alps to the present day and exhibit
discontinuous distribution, having meanwhile disappeared
in the intermediate tract between the latter
and their original home in Asia. The lowlands of
Eastern and Central Europe were either occupied by
the sea or by large freshwater lakes, so as effectually
to prevent a direct migration northward.</p>

<p>When the newer migrants arrived from Asia not
only had the Alps risen to a lofty mountain chain
acting as an effectual barrier, but Southern Italy and
Greece had become disconnected. Some time after,
Sicily and Southern Italy also became separated.
Meanwhile the stream of migrants which consisted
less and less of typically southern forms, emigrants
from Central Asia and even Southern Siberia,
mingled with the southern forms on their way to
Europe, and these now poured across the newly
opened plain of Central and Northern Europe. But
it was not until some time after this that the Mediterranean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>Sea broke across the Ægean region, and that
the Northern Sea retired from the plains of Eastern
Russia to admit the typical Siberian fauna and flora
into our continent (<i>vide</i> pp. <a href="#Page_189">189</a>-<a href="#Page_241">241</a>).</p>

<p>I cannot close this chapter without referring to the
active distributional centre&mdash;or I might say, centre of
origin&mdash;of species situated in South-eastern Europe.
No group of animals is more instructive in elucidating
the paths of migration from this centre than
the terrestrial mollusca. Wherever the original home
of the genus <i>Clausilia</i> may have been in early Tertiary
times, it is certain that the most active centre of
origin is now, and has been for a considerable
time past, in South-eastern Europe. One of the
earliest migrants from that modern centre of this
interesting genus is <i>Clausilia bidentata</i>, which is the
only species found in Southern Spain, and one of
the two met with in Ireland, and which has been
observed in high altitudes in the Alps and in
Scandinavia. As we go eastward from Western
Europe the number of species of <i>Clausilia</i>, as we
have seen, increases until we reach a maximum in
the Balkan peninsula and the region of the Caucasus.
<i>Limax</i>, <i>Agriolimax</i>, and <i>Amalia</i>, three genera of
slugs, likewise appear to have originated in the same
region and spread over Europe from there. Some
species like <i>Limax maximus</i> and <i>L. marginatus</i> are
very ancient, and probably commenced their wanderings
in early Tertiary times. In this manner many
animals of European origin have joined the Oriental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
migrants in their westward and also in their later
northward travels. In a similar way species of plants
and animals of Alpine origin might have joined these
migrants in their northward course, and it is only
when we come to carefully analyse the constituent
parts of all these members which have come to us in
England from the south, that we realise the complexity
of their origin. Finally, even the Siberian
migrants mingled with the later Oriental ones, and
in some cases the decision as to whether a certain
species belongs to the former or to the latter migration
becomes a matter of great difficulty.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<p>Like the last chapter, this deals with the Asiatic migrants.
But while the former described the history of the northern
invasion, those animals which entered Europe from the south-east
are here more particularly referred to. They originated in
Central, Southern, and Western Asia. It is not easy to discriminate
in all cases between this Oriental migration and the
Siberian. To a certain extent, even an entry of Northern
Asiatic species has taken place by the southern route, and
<i>vice versâ</i>. On the other hand, southern species might have
come to Europe by the southern route&mdash;that is to say, to
the south of the Caspian&mdash;and also by the northern, which
lay to the north of that great inland sea. The Red Deer is a
good example. It arrived on our continent by both routes.
However, there is a racial difference in the members of the two
migrations. The small race now found in Corsica, Sardinia,
North-west Africa, and Western Europe, is probably the older<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
of the two, while the larger one&mdash;resembling the American
Wapiti Deer&mdash;arrived very much later from Siberia.</p>

<p>The Mammoth, Wild Boar, Badger, the Dippers and Pheasants,
are all Oriental species which have come to us from the
south-east; but there are also Reptiles and Amphibians, and a
host of Invertebrates. Not all the animals, for instance, which
have reached us in England from the south-east are of Asiatic
origin. There is an active centre of distribution in South-eastern
Europe itself, from which species radiate out in all
directions. This fact is well illustrated by the genus <i>Clausilia</i>.
Species from this centre, and also from the Alps, joined the
Oriental stream in their northward course.</p>

<p>In reviewing a number of instances of Oriental species in
Europe, one is struck by the peculiarity of their having apparently
followed two distinct routes. All entered from Asia
Minor, which is proved to have been connected with Greece
until recent geological times. From here some seem to have
proceeded straight west, others northward. Further study
reveals the fact that the first route was followed by a much
older set of migrants at a time when the Mediterranean area
was greatly different from what it is at the present day.
Greece was then joined to Southern Italy, Sicily, and Tunis.
The latter was also connected with Sardinia and Corsica, and
the Straits of Gibraltar did not exist. Under such geographical
conditions a direct migration on land from Southern Greece to
Spain was not only possible, but was actually undertaken by
a very large number of Oriental species.</p>

THE LUSITANIAN FAUNA.</h2>


<p>Under the Roman Emperor Augustus, the Spanish
peninsula was divided into three provinces, one of
which&mdash;namely Lusitania&mdash;occupied a large portion of
the present area of Portugal. The term "Lusitanian"
is therefore almost synonymous with Portuguese, but
it has frequently been applied by zoologists and
botanists in a much wider sense, so as to vaguely
include the extreme south-west of Europe without
any definite limits. Neither do I propose to restrict
the term to everything found within the borders of
Portugal. For the sake of convenience, we may
designate as Lusitanian forms those animals and
plants which have migrated to Central, Southern, or
Northern Europe from South-western Europe. They
may really be North-west African species, or they
may have originated on land which lay to the west of
Portugal, and which is now mostly buried beneath a
deep sea. Nevertheless, we have received them from
the extreme south-western portion of our continent&mdash;they
have come to greater Europe from that
direction.</p>

<p>In discussing the component elements of the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
fauna and flora in the third chapter, I have already
referred to the distinguishing characters of the Lusitanian
migrants and to their distribution. I need
only repeat, therefore, that these are now principally
confined to the south-western portions of the British
Islands. The late Edward Forbes was the first to
trace the Lusitanian flora to its native home. In his
classical memoir on the geological relations of the
existing fauna and flora of the British Isles, he laid
the foundations of a new method of research. We are
as yet only beginning to realise the far-reaching
conclusions obtainable by a careful study of the
geographical distribution of animals and plants,
though the lines of investigation were indicated
by him more than fifty years ago. Forbes was
of opinion that the Lusitanian element in the British
flora was of miocene age, and that it survived the
Glacial period on a now sunken land to the south-west
of Ireland. Mr. Carpenter and myself agree
in so far that we are both inclined to look upon
this Lusitanian flora and the accompanying fauna
in Ireland as of pre-glacial origin. But I am
not quite satisfied that the Lusitanian migration
ceased to come north then. It may have received
a temporary check; but the presence, for instance,
of the Dartford Warbler (<i>Melizophilus undatus</i>) in
the south-east of England would seem to indicate
that its northward migration took place in very
recent times. It is possible also that the very
restricted occurrence of the Dartford Warbler may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
imply that it is gradually withdrawing towards its
centre of origin from a former wider range. Such
an eventuality, as we have seen, has actually taken
place in a great number of instances.</p>

<p>It is not only in the British Islands that we
perceive the influence of the Lusitanian element.
Scandinavia, Russia&mdash;indeed almost every part of
Europe&mdash;can boast of some migrants which have
originated in South-western Europe or on the
mysterious lands which lay beyond it. As a rule,
however, we notice a marked decrease of Lusitanian
species as we travel eastward from Western Europe.
Nevertheless, certain forms have travelled far beyond
the confines of our continent, and we certainly meet
with them in Asia and Northern Africa.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that we are apt to mistake sometimes
for Lusitanian migrants species which are of
Oriental origin. In a previous paper I classed such
animals which had apparently originated in South-western
Europe, but had really come from Asia by a
circuitous southern route, with the Lusitanians. However,
there is really no reason why the two should
not be kept apart, provided we can discriminate
between the pseudo-Lusitanians and the true ones.
I have already indicated in the last chapter how
these pseudo-Lusitanian migrants originated.</p>

<p>Supposing an Oriental species had left Asia for
Europe in miocene times, it would on its arrival in
Greece have had to decide between two courses. It
could either advance into the newly-formed Alpine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
peninsula and there remain, or at once push on westward
into Southern Italy, Sicily, and Tunis, by means
of the old land-connections, and thence into Southern
Spain. The Atlantic communicated at that time with
the Mediterranean across the valley of the Guadalquivir;
but that connection ceased to exist towards
the end of the Miocene Epoch, when the Oriental
migrants were free to ramble through Spain and the
whole of the North European plain. I have indicated
on a previous occasion (<i>a</i>, p. 484) that the earliest
members of the Red Deer migration, which have left
their traces in the caves of Malta, and whose descendants
still live in Corsica, Sardinia, and North Africa,
may have found their way to Northern Europe in
this manner. Many other Asiatic mammals probably
reached the British Islands in a similar way.</p>

<p>I cannot call to mind any large species of
mammal which we might reasonably suppose to
have originated in South-western Europe. Even
among the smaller ones, few give us any definite
clue in this respect. For instance, the present range
of the genus <i>Myogale</i>&mdash;a small Insectivore belonging
to the Mole family (<i>Talpidæ</i>)&mdash;teaches us nothing.
The two living species show discontinuous distribution,
and are almost confined to Europe. <i>Myogale</i>
occurs fossil in French miocene deposits, but is
unknown beyond the confines of our continent. It is
therefore probably of West European origin. The
gap between the South Russian <i>M. moschata</i> and the
Spanish <i>M. pyrenaica</i> is bridged over in so far as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
know from fossil evidence that the former had a
much wider range in pleistocene times, being then
found in England, Belgium, and Germany. <i>Talpa</i>,
too,&mdash;to which genus our common Mole belongs,&mdash;seems
to be a West European genus, since it occurs
in French miocene deposits. However, it would be
difficult to name many more recent genera which could
be included in the area which I propose to investigate
in this chapter. The genus <i>Lepus</i> is probably not of
Lusitanian origin, but the sub-genus <i>Oryctolagus</i>&mdash;to
which our common Rabbit belongs&mdash;has no doubt had
its original home in that region. Only two species of
<i>Lepus</i> (<i>Oryctolagus</i>) are known, one of which&mdash;<i>Lepus
lacostei</i>&mdash;has been met with in French pliocene
deposits. The other is the Rabbit (<i>L. cuniculus</i>).
Though generally considered to have been introduced
into the British Islands, no reason can be
brought forward in favour of such a supposition,
especially as it is known to have spread into
Germany in pleistocene times from South-western
Europe. It occurs in France, the Spanish peninsula,
North-western Africa, and on some of the Mediterranean
islands. Its nearest living relatives, as we
should almost expect, are found in South America.</p>

<p>Of the Lusitanian Birds I have already mentioned
the so-called Dartford Warbler (<i>Melizophilus undatus</i>),
which ranges from the south of England to the
extreme south-west of Europe. A second species
occurs on the Balearic Islands and on Corsica,
Sardinia, and Sicily. The Andalusian Bush-quail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
(<i>Turnix sylvatica</i>) is probably of North African
origin, and has subsequently spread into Southern
Spain and Portugal, and eastward as far as Sicily.
It is an instance of a migrant utilising the old
Mediterranean land-connections in the opposite direction
from that described in the last chapter.</p>

<p>Two of our British Wagtails are very closely
related, so much so that it requires a very critical eye
to distinguish them even at close range. They also
frequently interbreed. In their distribution, however,
there is a considerable difference between the White
Wagtail (<i>Motacilla alba</i>) and the Pied Wagtail
(<i>M. lugubris</i>). While the former ranges almost
all over Europe and Asia, the latter is a local
form resident in the British Islands, Southern
Scandinavia, and France, and a winter visitor to
Spain and North-west Africa. The genus <i>Motacilla</i>
is probably Oriental in its origin, but it seems as if
the Pied Wagtail was a Lusitanian species which
had gradually spread northward, only to return to
South-western Europe in severe weather for shelter.</p>

<p>The Bearded Titmouse (<i>Panurus biarmicus</i>)&mdash;the
only representative of the family <i>Panuridæ</i>&mdash;may
possibly be a Lusitanian bird. The fact of its
being absent from Scandinavia and Northern Russia
is suggestive of a southern origin. It is doubtful
whether the bird occurs on the south side of the
Mediterranean, but it is common in the south of
France and Spain, and has also been observed in
Sicily, Greece, and Asia Minor. In Central Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
it is found sparingly, and eastward its range extends
as far as Turkestan.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Fringilla</i>, which belongs to the great
family of the Finches, appears to be not only of
European origin, but, if the range of the species
counts for anything, I should feel inclined to locate
their home in the south-west. Altogether, five
species are known. One of them, viz., <i>Fringilla
teydea</i>, is confined to the Island of Teneriffe; another,
<i>F. madeirensis</i>, is found in Madeira, the Canaries,
and the Azores; a third, <i>F. spodiogenys</i>, inhabits
North-west Africa. The two remaining species
have a much wider range. <i>F. c&oelig;lebs</i>&mdash;the common
Chaffinch&mdash;occurs in Europe, while its range extends
eastward to Western Siberia, Persia, and Turkestan.
The other&mdash;<i>F. montifringilla</i>, known as the Brambling&mdash;is
more common in Northern Europe, and
generally frequents the more northern latitudes of
Asia as far as Japan.</p>

<p>It might be urged that the peculiar little blue
Magpie of Spain&mdash;<i>Cyanopolius Cooki</i>&mdash;should find a
place among the Lusitanian species, since there is
no bird like it anywhere else in Europe. But in
Eastern Siberia there lives a bird so closely allied
as to be barely distinguishable from it. Nevertheless,
since there are some distinguishing characters, it
has received a distinct name&mdash;<i>C. cyanus</i>. This is a
most interesting and remarkable case of discontinuous
distribution, which may perhaps be explained by the
supposition that the genus is of Oriental origin, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
has died out at its former headquarters in Southern
Asia and all along the line of migration, except at
the extreme limits of the range in both directions&mdash;east
and west.</p>

<p>As we go down in the scale of life&mdash;among the lower
vertebrates and invertebrates&mdash;we meet with a greater
number of prominent members of the Lusitanian
migration. The Bullfinch, Dipper, and Chough,
which might be thought to be of Lusitanian origin,
are, as I have shown in the last chapter, Asiatic.</p>

<p>The European snakes seem to be all of eastern
origin, unless <i>Tropidonotus viperinus</i> might be claimed
as a Lusitanian form. Of very great interest from
a zoogeographical point of view is our only European
member of the South American and African family
<i>Amphisbænidæ</i>. This species&mdash;<i>Blanus cinereus</i>&mdash;is
of the size and shape of an ordinary earth-worm,
from which, however, it may be distinguished by its
snake-like wriggling motions. It lives under stones
in Spain and Portugal, North-west Africa, and
Greece. It has, therefore, a somewhat similar distribution
to that of many of the animals and
plants referred to in the last chapter. But here
we have an animal which has evidently utilised the
old Mediterranean route described on p. <a href="#Page_271">271</a>, from
west to east. Two other species of <i>Blanus</i> inhabit
Asia Minor and Syria, but most of its nearest relations
either live in South America or tropical Africa. In
migrating to North and West Africa, its ancestors
probably made use of the land-bridge which spanned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
the Atlantic in early Tertiary times. Another
Lusitanian Lizard&mdash;belonging not to an aberrant
group, but to the typical Lacertidæ&mdash;is <i>Psammodromus
hispanicus</i>. It is rather variable in colour&mdash;generally
of a brown or green&mdash;and grows to a length
at about four or five inches. It occurs throughout
the Spanish peninsula and also in Southern France.
One of the handsomest European Lizards, which
reaches almost a foot in length,&mdash;of an olive colour
with greenish or mother-of-pearl reflection, and with
two yellow stripes along each side of the body,&mdash;is
an allied species (<i>P. algirus</i>). From the Spanish
peninsula it passes into Southern France and North
Africa. Two other species of the genus are confined
to North-west Africa.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that the genus <i>Pelobates</i> is of
south-western origin. Of the two known species of
this genus of Toads, one is found in the Central
European plain and the other on the Spanish peninsula
and in France. The closely allied <i>Pelodytes
punctatus</i>, too, is confined to this south-western
district, and their nearest relations are found in
Mexico. Similarly, the genus to which the Midwife
Toad (<i>Alytes obstetricans</i>) belongs may have its
original home in that part of Europe. Of the two
species, one is confined to France, Switzerland,
Belgium, and Western Germany, and the other, viz.,
<i>Alytes cisternasii</i>, to Spain. <i>Discoglossus pictus</i>&mdash;a
well-known and conspicuous Toad in Southern
Europe&mdash;inhabits Spain, Algiers, and Tunis, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
islands of Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. From
the general range of the family <i>Discoglossidæ</i>, as
given in Mr. Boulenger's excellent catalogue, it
appears that nowhere in the vast space between
China and New Zealand has any member of the
family been discovered. The peculiar genus of
Salamander&mdash;<i>Chioglossa</i>&mdash;is quite confined to the
Spanish peninsula.</p>

<p>The Butterflies <i>Nemeobius lucina</i> and <i>Charaxes
jasius</i> may also have had their home in that south-western
district. To this migration also seems to
belong the genus <i>Gonepteryx</i>, which has so peculiar a
range in the British Islands. The only British species,
known as the Brimstone Butterfly (<i>Gonepteryx rhamni</i>),
occurs in the south of England and in the south and
west of Ireland. It is met with over the greater part
of Europe, and its range extends into Asia Minor and
Northern India, and then it reappears again in distinct
varieties in Japan and the Amur district. Three
other species of <i>Gonepteryx</i> are known from Tibet
and India, and one (<i>G. cleopatra</i>) from Southern
Europe and Northern Africa. All the remaining
species inhabit the west, viz., Brazil, Mexico, and
Venezuela. That the genus has migrated from
America eastward to Europe appears to be more
probable than a migration in the opposite direction.
At any rate, that an exchange of species between
the south-western portion of the Holarctic Region
and the Neotropical area took place is indicated by
the fact, not only that a variety of <i>G. cleopatra</i> has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
been found in Madeira, but also that the Canary
Islands possess a distinct form of <i>Gonepteryx</i>, viz.,
<i>G. cleobule</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Kobelt has given us such an exhaustive memoir
on the characteristic Mollusca of the different
zoogeographical provinces of Europe, that we are
particularly well informed as regards that group of
Invertebrates. He tells us that the group <i>Torquilla</i>
of the genus <i>Pupa</i>&mdash;which is a small chrysalis-like
snail&mdash;is especially characteristic of the Pyrenees,
Spain, and Portugal. In a certain measure they
replace there the <i>Clausiliæ</i> which, as we have seen in
the last chapter, have come from the east and are
almost entirely absent in the south-west of Europe.
Of about seventy species of <i>Torquilla</i>, the larger
number are confined to this district, and some, which
like <i>Pupa</i> (<i>Torquilla</i>) <i>granum</i>, range eastward, have
travelled along the old Mediterranean highway, <i>viâ</i>
Algiers, Sicily and Greece, to Asia Minor. They
are still found along the whole of this route.</p>

<p>Similarly, we are told by the same author, that
<i>Gonostoma</i>&mdash;a group of the large genus <i>Helix</i>&mdash;has a
number of species in the same south-western district,
while only one, viz., <i>Helix obvoluta</i>, occurs in England
and Germany, and two in the Alps. Southward we
again find many representatives crossing over to
North Africa, among which <i>Helix lenticula</i> has a
similar range to <i>Pupa granum</i>, which I have just
referred to. The Alpine sub-genus <i>Campylaea</i> is
quite absent in the Lusitanian district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p><p>Among our own British testaceous Land Mollusca,
several <i>Helices</i>, viz., <i>Helix pisana</i>, <i>ericetorum</i>, <i>virgata</i>,
<i>acuta</i>, <i>fusca</i>, <i>rotundata</i>, <i>aculeata</i>, and probably many
others, have come to us from the south-west. The
species of <i>Hyalinia</i> are undoubtedly of very remote
origin, and it would be futile at the present state of
our knowledge to speculate as to their home. Some
of our species may possibly be of British origin.
<i>Balea perversa</i> is probably a south-western species,
and certainly <i>Pupa anglica</i>, which is quite confined to
Western Europe.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 18.</span>&mdash;The Spotted Slug (<i>Geomalacus maculosus</i>).</p>

<p>Much more characteristic of South-western Europe,
however, than these land-shells are some of the slugs.
The peculiar genus <i>Geomalacus</i> is almost entirely
confined to Portugal. One species, which I have
had several occasions to refer to in illustration of the
term "discontinuous distribution," ranges far beyond
the confines of that country. This is <i>Geomalacus
maculosus</i> (<a href="#Figure18">Fig. 18</a>), first discovered in the south-west
of Ireland, and more recently also in Portugal.
Although careful search has been made for it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
other parts of the British Islands, this slug has only
been found in the portion of Ireland just indicated.
Within the last few years I have taken it, up to a
height of over a thousand feet, on the promontory
north of the Kenmare River, also from sea-level up
to a considerable height near Glengariff, and more
recently Messrs. Praeger and Welch discovered it in
abundance near the town of Kenmare. But beyond
this rather circumscribed area in the counties of Cork
and Kerry it does not occur (<i>vide</i> <a href="#Figure19">Fig. 19</a>). Several
Portuguese species of this interesting genus have
since been added to science by Dr. Simroth and
others. Dr. Simroth, too, has promulgated the view
that the genus <i>Arion</i>&mdash;to which our common brown
garden slug belongs&mdash;is of Lusitanian origin. Indeed,
the number of species of <i>Arion</i> diminishes as we
leave that province, though one extends beyond the
borders of Europe into Siberia. The same number of
species, viz. five, occur in Germany and in England.
<i>Testacella</i>&mdash;a slug-like mollusc&mdash;which lives underground
on earthworms, and of which genus three
species, viz. <i>T. maugei</i>, <i>T. haliotidea</i>, <i>T. scutulum</i>,
are known to inhabit the British Islands, is another
Lusitanian animal. All the species are confined to
Western Europe and North Africa; they do not even
reach Germany or Switzerland.</p>

</div>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 19.</span>&mdash;Map of the British Islands on which the geographical distribution
of <i>Geomalacus maculosus</i> is indicated in black.</p>

<p>I have had occasion to mention once before an extremely
interesting genus of blind Woodlouse, viz.,
<i>Platyarthrus</i>. Like <i>Testacella</i>, it lives underground,
and also resembles it in its general range. Its distribution
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>is therefore of particular interest. It is difficult to
conceive that <i>Platyarthrus</i>, from its peculiar mode of
life could have crossed any formidable barrier, such
as even a narrow straits of sea. Its occurrence in
Spain and North Africa indicates, therefore, that the
Straits of Gibraltar did not exist at the time when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
it undertook the migration southward, just as the
English Channel and the Irish Sea could not have
been there when it wandered to England and Ireland.
The species which occurs in the south of England
has a wide range in Ireland, and reaches in Scotland
its most northern European limit of distribution.
<i>Platyarthrus</i> is only one of the Lusitanian genera of
woodlice. In Ireland&mdash;chiefly on the west coast&mdash;we
also find a brilliantly coloured Woodlouse, which is
absent from Great Britain, viz. <i>Metoponorthus cingendus</i>.
It reappears again on the Continent in the south of
France. Its range is therefore suggestive of a Lusitanian
origin; and indeed, when we examine the
general distribution of the genus <i>Metoponorthus</i>, we
find that out of the forty-four known species, fully
one-half are confined to Western Europe and North
Africa.</p>

<p>My friend and colleague, Mr. Carpenter, informs
me that among the Irish Spiders he is acquainted
with, the following are to be looked upon as Lusitanian
species:&mdash;</p>

<ul class="lsoff">
<li>Dysdera crocota.</li>
<li>Oonops pulcher.</li>
<li>Tegenaria hibernica.</li>
<li>Theridion aulicum.</li>
<li>Lasæola inornata.</li>
<li>Agroeca celans.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 1em;margin-right:1em;">do.</span>gracilipes.</li>
<li>Teutana grossa.</li>
<li>Cnephalocotes curtus.</li>
<li>Porrhomma myops.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the <i>Coleoptera</i>, the genera <i>Trichis</i>, <i>Glycia</i>, and
<i>Singilis</i>, all belonging to the Running Beetles (<i>Carabidæ</i>),
are almost confined to the Spanish peninsula.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p><p>The beetles <i>Rhopalomesites Tardyi</i>, <i>Eurynebria
complanata</i>, and <i>Otiorrhynchus auropunctatus</i> also
belong to this fauna, as also the Earthworms <i>Allolobophora
veneta</i> and <i>A. Georgii</i>, and the Millipede
<i>Polydesmus gallicus</i>.</p>

<p>It will be evident to every one from these few
instances of Lusitanian species, that somewhere in
South-western Europe and North-western Africa,
and also, perhaps, in a larger now submerged western
land-area, there existed an active centre of development,
from which animals spread in all directions.</p>

<p>If the presence of <i>Platyarthrus</i> in North-west Africa
proves that the Straits of Gibraltar had come into
existence after its southward migration, it also
suggests that the ancestral home of this woodlouse
was in the Spanish peninsula. Whether this supposition
is correct or not, does not affect the Straits
of Gibraltar problem, for in a migration northward
into Spain from Morocco a land-connection would be
equally necessary. Almost every group of vertebrates
and invertebrates furnishes instances of species which
must have crossed the Straits on dry land. Many
naturalists have come to this conclusion, and have
clearly expressed their views on the subject. At
the commencement of the present period, says Mr.
Bourguignat (p. 354), the north of Africa was a
peninsula of Spain, the Straits of Gibraltar did not
exist, and the Mediterranean communicated by the
Sahara with the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The faunas of North-west Africa and the south-western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>portion of our continent are so closely
related, that an uninterrupted intercourse by land
must have existed for a very long period. The
Mediterranean, however, throughout the Tertiary
period&mdash;at any rate since miocene times&mdash;must have
had almost constant communication with the Atlantic.
According to Professor Suess, this was the case. The
Atlantic was joined with the Mediterranean across
the valley of the Guadalquivir during the Miocene
Epoch, so that Andalusia must have belonged to
North Africa in those days. The Straits of Gibraltar
are supposed to have been formed in the next epoch.
I have already expressed my disagreement with that
theory from a zoogeographical point of view. The
old Guadalquivir connection probably persisted much
longer,&mdash;though interrupted by temporary periods of
a partial retreat&mdash;so as to uncover sufficient land to
allow of an interchange during miocene as well as
pliocene times between the European and North
African faunas. It is in this way, perhaps, that some
of the members of the Alpine fauna have reached
Spain by way of Corsica, Sardinia, and North-western
Africa, and <i>vice versâ</i>. The Balearic Islands were
then connected with Spain; and we find there many
curious survivals which have long ago become extinct
on the mainland.</p>

<p>That the Straits of Gibraltar are only of recent
formation has been suggested on zoogeographical
evidence by Bourguignat, Simroth, Kobelt, and many
others. Dr. Kobelt believes that the former land-connection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>between the south of Spain and Morocco
was much wider than is generally assumed, and that
the coast-line stretched from Oran in Algeria straight
across to Cartagena in Spain (<i>b</i>, ii., p. 228).</p>

<p>My allusions to the lands lying beyond the Lusitanian
province, refer chiefly to the Canary Islands
and Madeira. Whatever doubts Dr. Wallace had
on the subject of their former connection with
Morocco, it cannot be denied that they used to be
of much larger extent, especially in miocene and
pliocene times. It seems extremely probable that
these islands formed part of the mainland of North
Africa until comparatively recently, and that they
are the last traces of a sunken continent which united
Africa and South America. A discussion of this
problem, however, must be deferred, as it is a complicated
one, and one which would lead me altogether
outside the scope of this little volume. I
hope I shall have an opportunity to publish my
views on this subject before long, meanwhile the
reader must content himself with this mere statement.</p>

<p>During the greater portion of the Miocene, and I
think for part of the Pliocene Epoch too, the advance
of the Lusitanian species eastward was barred on
the continent of Europe by an arm of the sea which
stretched northward along the Rhone valley from
the Mediterranean. The Lusitanian forms which
originated in Southern Spain were able to travel east
during these times by way of North-west Africa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
Sicily, Southern Italy, and Greece; it is possible
that some may have reached the Alps in this manner,
and Eastern Europe generally. That the Lusitanian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>centre was never a very active one compared
with, for instance, the Oriental is indicated by many
distributional facts. It is difficult to understand,
however, why the Oriental species, on the whole,
have migrated so far west, while few Lusitanians have
gone very far east. This seems to have been noted
particularly in the case of the flora. Mr. Bonnet drew
attention to the fact that in Tunis there are none of the
absolutely characteristic plants of Morocco and Spain,
while the Oriental flora is represented by a good
many species. Lusitanian species have spread chiefly
southward into North Africa, and northward into
France, the British Islands, and even Scandinavia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
As I have mentioned in the third chapter, there are a
good many species of Lusitanian origin in the British
Islands. However, we have only a mere remnant
of what we ought to have, had the climate been less
trying. It is probable, too, that the submergence
destroyed a good many plants and the insects dependent
on them. That the Lusitanian fauna is very
ancient in the British Islands is proved by the fact
of the discontinuous distribution of so many species.
A greater number survived in Ireland than in
England.</p>

<p>Altogether&mdash;and this was strongly urged by
Edward Forbes&mdash;the Lusitanian element is the
oldest of the components of our fauna, and it must
have poured into the British Islands for many geological
periods almost without cessation. The same
author, in his classic essay, refers especially to the
Lusitanian flora, two prominent members of which
are the British plants, <i>Arbutus unedo</i> (<a href="#Figure20">Fig. 20</a>, p. <a href="#Page_305">305</a>)
and <i>Euphorbia hiberna</i> (<a href="#Figure21">Fig. 21</a>, p. <a href="#Page_306">306</a>). The former
has a wide range in the Mediterranean region, and
occurs in the British Islands only in the south-west
of Ireland. The Spurge, on the other hand, is also
found in the south-west of England, besides Ireland
and Southern Europe.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p><h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER VII.</h3>

<p>The term "Lusitanian" is in this chapter employed in the
wide sense, as indicating the South-west of Europe and North-western
Africa. From this centre, and probably also from a
now sunken land which lay to the west of it, issued a fauna and
flora of which we have abundant evidence in our own islands,
especially in Ireland. Edward Forbes held that the Lusitanian
element of the British flora was of miocene age, and that it
survived the Glacial period in this country.</p>

<p>At the time when the Straits of Gibraltar did not exist, and
when there was free land communication between Asia Minor,
Greece, and Tunis, many Oriental species migrated westward
by this ancient Mediterranean route as far as Spain. They
would then have invaded the more central parts of Europe from
the south-west, without however being of Lusitanian origin. Of
the true Lusitanian mammals a typical example is the Rabbit.
Then we have a few birds and several interesting reptiles and
amphibians. The genus to which the Brimstone Butterfly
belongs is also of south-western origin. A number of Mollusca
are mentioned which from their range likewise indicate a Lusitanian
origin. Most of our British Slugs and many of our
larger Snails belong to this group.</p>

<p>All these are merely a small remnant of what we received
from South-western Europe during the Miocene and Pliocene
Epochs. But they spread into many parts of Europe, and a
few even crossed into Asia. The antiquity of the Lusitanian
element in our fauna is especially indicated by the frequent
recurrence of "discontinuous distribution" among the species
belonging to that section.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

THE ALPINE FAUNA.</h2>


<p>We are told by Sir Archibald Geikie (p. 851) that
"from the Pyrenees eastwards, through the Alps and
Apennines into Greece, and the southern side of
the Mediterranean basin, through the Carpathian
Mountains and the Balkan into Asia Minor, and
thence through Persia and the heart of Asia to
the shores of China and Japan, a series of massive
limestones has been traced, which, from the abundance
of their characteristic foraminifera, have been
called the Nummulitic Limestone. Unlike the thin,
soft, modern-looking, undisturbed beds of the Anglo-Parisian
area, these limestones attain a depth of
sometimes several thousand feet of hard, compact,
sometimes crystalline rock, passing even into marble,
and they have been folded and fractured on such a
colossal scale that their strata have been heaved up
into lofty mountain crests sometimes 10,000, and
in the Himalaya range more than 16,000 feet above
the sea." "Nowhere in Europe," continues the
same author (p. 860), "do oligocene strata play
so important a part in the scenery of the land, or
present on the whole so interesting and full a picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
of the state of Europe when they were deposited, as
in Switzerland. Rising into massive mountains, as
in the well-known Rigi and Rossberg, they attain a
thickness of more than 6000 feet." "By far the larger
portion of these strata is of lacustrine origin. They
must have been formed in a large lake, the area of
which probably underwent gradual subsidence during
the period of deposition, until in Miocene times the
sea once more overflowed the area."</p>

<p>From these remarks by our most eminent British
geologist, we gather that in early Tertiary times
much of the present area of Switzerland was either a
sea or a large freshwater lake. The Alps were then
appearing in this sea, probably as a chain of islands,
and in the beginning of the Miocene Epoch one large
elongated island had made its appearance&mdash;the future
European Alps. I have already mentioned that the
Miocene Sea skirted the Alps from the Mediterranean
up the valley of the Rhone and along its northern and
eastern margin. Miocene marine deposits are also
known from the Southern Alps and the east side of
the Apennines, from Corsica, Sardinia, and Malta.
No trace, however, of them has been noticed anywhere
along the Ægean Sea or on the Balkan
peninsula. The Alps were therefore connected to the
east with the outliers of the Balkan Mountains, and
in this way with Asia, from which they received so
large a proportion of their fauna and flora. In
pliocene times the sea still washed the southern shore
of the Alps, but to the north dry land gradually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
supplemented the sea, and the Alpine fauna and
flora were able to pour into the plain. It was then
that the Arctic species&mdash;which we have learned had
migrated into Northern Europe from the north&mdash;found
their way to the Alps. In a similar way Lusitanian
forms&mdash;in fact, species from almost all parts of
Europe&mdash;were now free to wander to the newly opened
up peninsula which had become part of the mainland
of Europe. The typical Siberian species had
not entered our continent at that time, it was not till
much later&mdash;not until the middle of the Pleistocene
Epoch&mdash;that they made their appearance at the foot
of the Alps, but, as we shall see later on, it is doubtful
whether many of these species ever reached the
mountains.</p>

<p>The fauna of the Alps, and also the flora, is
therefore made up of a number of component elements.
In the first place we have the Oriental element&mdash;the
migrants from Central and Southern Asia.
When the nature and origin of the Oriental fauna in
Europe was discussed, reference was made to the fact
(p. <a href="#Page_272">272</a>) that we can distinguish an older from a newer
Oriental migration. Both of these have entered the
Alps. As we might anticipate, many of the older
Oriental migrants have developed into new species,
laying the foundation of an indigenous Alpine
element. From the fact that they set foot on the
Alpine peninsula, it might be expected that there
could have existed no mountains to speak of. The
climate was mild and damp. Now as the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
rose, and a formidable mountain range took the place
of a hilly island, the whole fauna was lifted up
and transferred to entirely different conditions. A
modification of their structure to suit the new surroundings
was therefore to be anticipated, and that is
exactly what occurred, though not in all cases.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the goats which are of Asiatic
origin. Every one has heard of the "Steinbock,"&mdash;the
Alpine mountain goat (<i>Capra ibex</i>)&mdash;though very few
have seen it in its native haunts, where it is now on
the verge of extinction. A closely allied species
(<i>Capra sibirica</i>) inhabits the Altaï and Himalayan
Mountains; a third species (<i>Capra sinaitica</i>) lives in
Palestine, and has entered Egypt by way of the
Sinaitic peninsula. Another (<i>C. ægagrus</i>) occurs in
Asia Minor, Persia, the island of Crete, and some of
the Cyclades. This exemplifies what I remarked in the
last chapter about the former land-connection between
Greece and the Asiatic continent. Finally, we have
the Pyrenean Goat (<i>Capra pyrenaica</i>), which is found
in the Pyrenees, the higher ranges of Central Spain,
in Andalusia, and Portugal, thus indicating that it
probably reached the Spanish peninsula from the
south by means of the old Sicilo-Algerian highway,
especially as remains of the species occur in the
cave deposits of Gibraltar. The ancestors of the
goat-like Antelope&mdash;known as the Chamois (<i>Rupicapra
tragus</i>)&mdash;no doubt also came from Asia. The genus is
not represented there, but <i>Nemorh&oelig;dus</i> and <i>Budorcas</i>
are allied Asiatic genera, while the Rocky Mountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Goat (<i>Haploceros montanus</i>) also has certain affinities
with the Chamois. Besides the Alps, the latter
occurs in the Caucasus and the Pyrenees. The
Alpine Marmot (<i>Arctomys marmotta</i>) is sometimes
quoted as owing its origin to the Siberian pleistocene
migration, but it does not occur in Siberia now, nor
is there any palæontological evidence that it was ever
found there. The genus <i>Arctomys</i> is an ancient
Asiatic genus, to judge from its general range.
Only two species occur in Europe, one of which,
the true Siberian Marmot (<i>A. bobac</i>), just enters our
continent in the east&mdash;or rather, it is one of those
species which came to us in pleistocene times and are
now gradually retreating towards their native land.
The genus, however, is probably not of Siberian
origin. No less than seven other species occur in
Asia, six of which are confined to Central Asia and
the Himalayan Mountains, while four have wandered
to North America. The sequence of events, therefore,
was that the ancestor of <i>Arctomys marmotta</i> probably
came to the Alps direct from Central Asia by way
of Asia Minor in miocene or pliocene times. It has
since become modified into a distinct species, and has
spread to the European plain, where it occurs fossil
in pleistocene strata, and to the Carpathian Mountains
and the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>The great majority of species of the large genus
<i>Microtus</i> (<i>Arvicola</i>) are Asiatic, and there can be little
doubt that it has originated in that continent. There
is one species of Vole (<i>Microtus nivalis</i>) which occurs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
in the high Alps, and which has been supposed to be a
typical Alpine form. It is known, however, to occur
also in North Italy and in Bohemia, while <i>Microtus
leucurus</i> of the Pyrenees is identical with this
species. But its range is by no means confined to
Europe, for it has also been discovered in Syria
and Palestine, while a closely allied form exists in
the Himalayan Mountains. This shows clearly that
the species has migrated to the Alps from Asia
Minor. That this migration may have taken place
at an early period&mdash;at a time when Sardinia and
Corsica were still connected with Southern Europe&mdash;is
indicated by the occurrence of an extinct Vole
(<i>Microtus brecciensis</i>) in Sardinian and Corsican
pleistocene (?) deposits.</p>

<p>All the Alpine species mentioned except the
Chamois can be easily traced to their former Asiatic
home. But even it has its nearest relations in Asia.
I might also refer to another Vole (<i>Evotomys Nageri</i>)
which is practically confined to the Alps and
Northern Italy, and which has probably originated
there, though most of its nearest relations are either
Asiatic or North American species.</p>

<p>But besides these Asiatic immigrants and their
modified descendants we have a small truly native
Alpine mammalian fauna. <i>Sorex alpinus</i>&mdash;the Alpine
Shrew&mdash;occurs only in the Alps, the Harz Mountains,
Pyrenees, and Carpathians. The genus has been
found in European eocene strata,&mdash;in vastly older
deposits in our own continent than elsewhere,&mdash;so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
that it is extremely probable that it has originated
there. It may then have developed a new centre of
distribution in the newly-formed Alps where both
<i>Sorex alpinus</i> and <i>S. minutus</i> (<i>pygmæus</i>) have their
home. From there they again spread&mdash;perhaps
already in miocene times&mdash;to Asia and North
America, where a large number of new species
originated. It seems to me even probable that one
of these Asiatic species of <i>Sorex</i>, viz. <i>S. araneus</i>
(<i>vulgaris</i>), subsequently migrated towards the old
home of its forefathers, since we find it more or less
confined to Central and Northern Asia and Northern
Europe.</p>

<p>Though the origin of the Alpine Hare has already
been referred to and fully discussed in a previous
chapter (p. <a href="#Page_148">148</a>), the conclusions arrived at may be
once more repeated. The Alpine Hare (<i>Lepus
variabilis</i>) is of Arctic origin. It spread southward
into Europe, North America, and Asia in early glacial
times, and reached our continent from Spitsbergen by
means of a direct land-connection with Lapland.
The Scandinavian peninsula was then separated from
Russia, but connected with Scotland and Ireland
(<a href="#Figure13">Fig. 13</a>, p. <a href="#Page_170">170</a>). Since England was then united to
France, the Alpine Hare was able to invade western
continental Europe and all the mountain ranges.
Its range is very discontinuous, small colonies being
scattered all over the mountainous parts of the
Northern Hemisphere, while the European Hare&mdash;a
closely allied species&mdash;occurs in the plain, and now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
occupies to some extent the former haunts of the
Alpine Hare (cf. <a href="#Figure08">Fig. 8</a>, p. <a href="#Page_137">137</a>). Might not the
European Hare, as suggested, possess some advantages
which enabled it to drive the other into more
inaccessible parts, thus producing the peculiarity
of range? The present distribution of the Alpine
and the European Hare (<i>L. Europæus</i>) appears to me
to strongly support such an assumption. It is not
the cold which has driven the Alpine Hare to the
Alps; and its presence there is not, as is often supposed,
a "<i>standing testimony of a former arctic
climate</i>" in Europe, but merely the necessary consequence
of the weaker species being thrust into
less accessible regions by a stronger rival.</p>

<p><i>Muscardinus avellanarius</i>,&mdash;the common Dormouse,&mdash;though
by no means confined to the Alps, has probably
originated there. It is found up to a height
of nearly 5000 feet in these mountains, and is spread
over Europe at nearly equal distances from the Alps
in all directions. Being absent from Ireland, Scotland,
Norway, and Northern Russia, it seems as
if it had only diffused northward in more recent
times.</p>

<p>The closely allied genus <i>Myoxus</i> is likewise of
European extraction, some species being known from
French eocene deposits.</p>

<p>There are only a few typically Alpine Birds. One of
these is the Alpine Accentor (<i>Accentor collaris</i>), which
on rare occasions visits England, and Northern
Europe generally. It is, however, by no means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
peculiar to the European Alps; a variety of this
species occurs in Central Asia, Eastern Siberia, and
Japan. The only other Accentor inhabiting our
continent is the Hedge Accentor (<i>A. modularis</i>),
which is resident over the greater part of it, and
also in North Africa and the Mediterranean Islands.
It also extends its range across the Ægean Sea to
Asia Minor, so that really not a single Accentor is
peculiar to Europe.</p>

<p>Both the European species are evidently old forms,
and the genus, as might be expected, is certainly
Asiatic. No less than ten other species of Accentor
are known, all of which are confined to Central Asia
and the Himalayan Mountains, and are therefore all
Holarctic. I may mention that much difference of
opinion still exists as to the true zoological position
of this anomalous genus. It has been located in
several different families by various ornithologists,
but has not yet found a permanent resting-place.
Another bird generally considered to be peculiar to
Switzerland is the Alpine Chough (<i>Pyrrhocorax
alpinus</i>), but its range extends across Asia Minor
to the Himalayas. Whether the European Chough
should not form a distinct genus is a matter of
opinion. Some of our leading ornithologists, like
Dr. B. Sharpe, are inclined to separate it from
<i>Pyrrhocorax</i>; however, there is no doubt that it is
closely related to the Alpine Chough, whatever view
we may take of the generic distinctness. It inhabits
principally Western and Southern Europe, also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
North Africa; and its range extends eastward to
the Himalayas, China, and Eastern Siberia. If any
doubt still existed as to the Asiatic origin of the
Choughs, it may be noted that the only two other
closely allied genera, viz., <i>Corcorax</i> and <i>Podoces</i>, live
in Australia and Central Asia respectively.</p>

<p>There are two other birds to which I should like
to refer. These are the Rock Sparrow and the Alpine
Snow Finch. The first of these (<i>Petronia stulta</i>) is
by no means peculiar to the Alps. It is the only
species of the genus inhabiting Europe; and besides
the Alps it occurs in Southern Europe generally,
and ranges as far west as the Canaries and Madeira.
Eastward it is not found beyond Central Asia. Of
the remaining five species of <i>Petronia</i>, two occur in
Asia (including India) and three in Africa. Whether
the genus is African or Asiatic is immaterial for our
purpose, since, in any case, the only European species
came to us from the east with the Oriental migration.
The distribution of the Alpine Snow Finch (<i>Montifringilla
nivalis</i>) is very similar to that of the birds we
have just been considering. It inhabits the Alps up
to a great height, but occurs also on the Pyrenees and
other South European mountain ranges as far east as
Palestine, where again it is found in the Lebanon.
The genus <i>Montifringilla</i> has seventeen other species.
Twelve of these live in Central Asia and Japan,
extending as far north as Kamtchatka, while five
inhabit Western North America right down to
Mexico. There is every probability that in this case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
also we have to deal with an Asiatic genus which
spread eastward to America, and westward to Europe.</p>

<p>As regards the Reptiles, there are <i>no</i> peculiar
Alpine forms, but among the Amphibia some species
deserve to be mentioned. Up to an elevation of
10,000 feet we find in the Alps the Black Salamander
(<i>Salamandra atra</i>); and it is apparently quite peculiar
to them, never having been observed in the plains.
The handsome black and yellow Salamander (<i>Salamandra
maculosa</i>)&mdash;so well known as a terrarium
specimen&mdash;likewise occurs in the Alps, and it has
besides a fairly wide distribution in Europe. It is
known from Southern Germany, the Pyrenees, Spain,
Portugal, Sardinia, Corsica, Greece, Syria, and Algiers.
A third species (<i>S. caucasica</i>) inhabits the Caucasus.
The evidence of distribution here points emphatically
to an Alpine origin of the genus <i>Salamandra</i>. We
cannot tell where the ancestors of <i>Salamandra</i> may
have come from, but several other genera of <i>Salamandridæ</i>
are certainly Asiatic. Our common Newt
(<i>Molge vulgaris</i>) belongs to a genus with nineteen
species, several of which are peculiar to Europe. The
general range of the genus, however, extends to North
America, and it is more probable therefore that it
originated in Asia. If so, it certainly must have
passed into Europe at a very early date. Let us
assume the first <i>Molges</i> to have traversed the Ægean
Sea on <i>terra firma</i> to Greece in miocene times, they
might thus have been able to travel straight on to
the old Tyrrhenian continent of which Corsica and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
Sardinia now form the remains, and also on to North-west
Africa. Indeed, we find high up in the Corsican
mountains an interesting large brownish-grey Newt
(<i>Molge montana</i>), and another in Sardinia (<i>Molge
Rusconii</i>). Again, in Algiers there are two species,
viz., <i>Molge Poireti</i> and <i>M. Hagenmülleri</i>, while the
Moroccan <i>M. Waltlii</i> passes into the south of Spain.
Here <i>Molge boscæ</i>, <i>M. aspera</i>, and <i>M. marmorata</i>
originated, the latter passing into France.</p>

<p>Another branch of the <i>Molge</i> tribe turned northward
from Greece towards the newly forming Alps;
and there originated <i>Molge alpestris</i> and <i>M. palmata</i>,
which more recently have spread into England (one at
least), Germany, France, Austria, and Southern Italy.
<i>Molge vulgaris</i> is an Asiatic species which wandered
northward after entering Europe, covering a large
area, but never reached the extreme south or south-west.
<i>M. cristata</i>&mdash;the large Water Newt&mdash;has a
similar but not quite so extended a range, while
<i>M. vittata</i> never managed to cross the borders of
Asia Minor. Some of the other species occur in
China, Japan, and North America.</p>

<p>None of the tailless Batrachians&mdash;the Frogs and
Toads&mdash;are peculiar to the Alps, but one, viz. <i>Rana
temporaria</i>, ascends to the height of no less than
10,000 feet. It is our common British Frog. No
other Frog probably ranges so far north or to such
heights.</p>

<p>Let us now inquire what the invertebrate fauna of
the Alps teaches us. We are told by Dr. Kobelt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
the great authority on European land shells, that a
uniformity of character marks the Alpine Molluscan
fauna (<i>b</i>, i., p. 251). One of the characteristic genera
<i>Campylaea</i>&mdash;often looked upon as a sub-genus of
<i>Helix</i>&mdash;is a group containing somewhat flattened
conspicuous snails of large size. These are found
everywhere in the Alps, and wherever they occur
beyond the confines of these mountains, remarks Dr.
Kobelt, their origin from the main stock is easily
traced. They have been gathered in the Apennines
in Sicily, and even beyond the Mediterranean in
Algeria. On the Balkan peninsula they occur right
down to the most southern point of Greece, but
are not met with either in Crete or Asia Minor.
One species has been found sub-fossil in Thuringia
in Northern Germany.</p>

<p>Another truly Alpine genus, says Dr. Kobelt, is
the operculate <i>Pomatias</i>, which in its geographical
distribution offers some interesting modifications from
that of <i>Campylaea</i>. Less limited to high elevations,
it has spread over a greater part of the plains. This
has happened especially in France, while in Germany
one species advances almost as far north as Heidelberg.
In other directions also the genus has travelled
beyond the limits of range of <i>Campylaea</i>. <i>Pomatias</i>
occurs in the Pyrenees and Northern Spain, in
Sardinia and Crete, and may, according to the same
author, be expected in Asia Minor, although no
species has as yet been met with there. In Greece,
again, it has been observed, and numerous species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
inhabit Tunis and Algeria. Dr. Kobelt connects the
wider range of <i>Pomatias</i> with the geological history
of the genus (<i>b</i>, i., p. 253). He tells us that species of
Pomatias have been found in eocene deposits differing
but little from our present forms, while undoubted
<i>Campylaeæ</i> are not met with till we reach the upper
Miocene.</p>

<p><i>Zonites</i> is, according to Dr. Kobelt, a third Alpine
genus, whose range scarcely differs from the other
two (<i>b</i>, i., p. 254). The centre of distribution lies at
present in one of the branches of the most southern
Alpine chain which help to form a large portion of
the Balkan peninsula. The bulk of the species
inhabit that peninsula, the Greek Islands (except
Crete) and Asia Minor. Neither in the Tyrol nor
in Switzerland do we find any <i>Zonites</i>, and the few
species that do occur in the south-eastern Alps
only just cross the outliers of these mountains.
Between the south-western Alps and the Rhone we
again find a <i>Zonites</i>&mdash;a remarkable case of discontinuous
distribution, since the nearest other habitat
of the genus is Monte Gargano in South-eastern
Italy, which is known to harbour a good many
interesting geographical puzzles.</p>

<p>We still have a good deal to learn as regards the
molluscan fauna of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica.
These islands have scarcely been more than skimmed
by conchologists, and <i>Zonites</i> may inhabit one or all
of these, which might indicate to us the manner in
which this genus travelled from Southern Italy to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Provence in the south of France. The distribution
of <i>Zonites</i> certainly does not seem to imply an
Alpine origin, because it is almost completely absent
from the Alps proper. But I do not think my views
differ materially from those of Dr. Kobelt, since the
Alps, in the wide sense, include the mountains of the
Balkan peninsula, where I should feel inclined to
locate the ancestral home of the genus.</p>

<p>The small operculate genus <i>Acme</i> is a similar
case. Dr. Kobelt places the centre of distribution
on the southern slope of the Alps, but scarcely
any of the species inhabit the Alps proper. Some
occur in France, others in North Africa, Sicily,
Southern Italy, and the Caucasus. It is evidently
a very ancient genus. The species live in moss or
underground, and are not likely to be transported
across the sea by accidental or occasional means of
distribution.</p>

<p>Still another genus, which resembles <i>Acme</i> in its
geographical distribution, is <i>Daudebardia</i>&mdash;a small
slug-like mollusc with a tiny shell. It does not,
however, range nearly so far north or west as <i>Acme</i>,
for it occurs neither in the British Islands nor in
Spain or the Pyrenees.</p>

<p>I shall not be able to refer to more than a few of
the most typical Alpine species of Lepidoptera, but
they may be taken as fair examples of the geographical
distribution of the rest of the group.</p>

<p>Even those visitors to Switzerland who do not
claim to be naturalists have heard of the remarkably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
handsome and stately Butterfly known as Apollo.
To the ardent entomologist, the first sight of this
typical Alpine species is a never-to-be-forgotten delight,
and he generally brings home with him a rich
harvest of specimens. The more experienced Butterfly
hunter knows that there are no less than three
different kinds of Apollo&mdash;or, as we should say more
correctly, of Parnassius&mdash;in Switzerland. There is
first the common Apollo (<i>Parnassius Apollo</i>), then
the rarer and more local <i>P. delius</i>, which inhabits
more elevated regions, and finally the still scarcer <i>P.
mnemosyne</i>, which is only known from the highest
mountain ranges. It may be a surprise to those who
have accustomed themselves to connect Apollo with
the Alps, and who think the two belong together and
cannot do without one another, to hear that it is
by no means confined to them. It is also found in
Scandinavia, France, Spain, Russia, and in Siberia.
<i>Parnassius delius</i> is confined to the European Alps
and the mountains of Central Asia, while <i>P. mnemosyne</i>
is known from the Pyrenees, Sweden, Hungary,
Sicily, Russia, and Western Asia. One other Parnassius
inhabits Europe, viz., <i>P. Nordmanni</i> of the
Caucasus, but all the remaining species of the genus&mdash;and
there are nearly thirty more&mdash;are confined to
Central Asia. A few, as we have seen, have reached
Europe, some have travelled to the Himalayan
Mountains, and others to Western North America.
The centre of distribution is certainly in Central
Asia, and we have no reason to suppose that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
original home in this case does not agree with that
centre.</p>

<p><i>Melitæa</i>, a genus to which some of our British
Fritillaries belong, has also some typically Alpine
members. Two of these, viz. <i>M. cynthia</i> and <i>M.
asteria</i>, are peculiar to the Alps, the latter being
only found at considerable elevations. Most of the
remaining fourteen European species are also found
in Central Asia. Thus the isolated <i>M. maturna</i>,
which in Europe is confined to Lapland, is also
known from the Altaï Mountains, which again are
near the centre of distribution, since some species
of <i>Melitæa</i> range across the Northern Pacific to
Western North America.</p>

<p>The small British Mountain Ringlet, and also the
Scotch Argus, belong to a genus of butterflies which
is very characteristic of the European Alps. But
owing to its enormous geographical distribution, its
probable home is somewhat difficult to ascertain.
Nevertheless it is a noteworthy genus, especially so
from the fact that the two British species <i>Erebia
epiphron</i> and <i>E. æthiops</i> are taken at first sight
for true Arctic migrants. As neither of them, however,
occurs in Scandinavia, Greenland, or Arctic
America, this supposition must be abandoned. They
must be looked upon as species which once had a
wider range in the southern parts of the British
Islands, and which have survived in a few isolated
localities, where they are apparently on the verge of
extinction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p><p>About sixty species of <i>Erebia</i> are known to
science, half of which are found in Europe, the
remainder in Siberia, the Himalayas, Arctic America,
Chili, Patagonia, South Africa, and Madagascar.
Though a few do range into these outlying regions
of the earth, Central Asia seems to lie near the centre
of distribution of the genus, and the probability is
that it also was its original home. Most of the
European species are high Alpine forms&mdash;<i>E. glacialis</i>
being met with at a height of 10,000 feet&mdash;and
these are generally quite peculiar to the Alps,
showing that their ancestors came from Asia at an
early date, probably by way of Asia Minor and
Greece. A few, as for instance <i>E. lappona</i>, range
right across to the Altaï Mountains from the Alps,
and at least one&mdash;<i>E. melas</i>&mdash;is found in Greece.
<i>Erebia</i> migrations seem therefore to have taken
place by the Southern or Oriental route at different
geological periods. But some of the European
species which are more or less confined to the plain,
and are either absent from Switzerland or do not
reach the higher elevations, appear to me to have
come by the more direct northern or Siberian highway,
at a still more recent period. These are <i>Erebia
æthiops</i>, <i>medusa</i>, <i>ligea</i>, and <i>ambla</i>.</p>

<p>Only one species of the well-known Polar genus
<i>&OElig;neis</i>, viz. <i>&OElig;. aëllo</i> occurs in the Alps. It has
always been taken at very high elevations near the
verge of the snow-line on the most lofty parts
of the Simplon Pass, and other similar situations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
Altogether about a dozen species of this genus of
butterfly are known, most of which are confined to
the polar regions of the Old World and the New,
though some have found their way to the extreme
south end of South America, in what manner is still
a mystery. Like the preceding genera, this also
appears to have emerged from Central Asia. The
genus, too, is closely allied to the last, and though its
range is not quite so extensive, it resembles it in
many respects. The Alpine species of <i>&OElig;neis</i> came
to Europe by the Oriental route. But the Lapland
species&mdash;at any rate <i>&OElig;. jutta</i> and <i>&OElig;. bore</i>&mdash;have
taken a somewhat circuitous route to reach our
continent. They first migrated from Asia to North
America, and then by the old land-connections by
way of Greenland to Lapland. It is noteworthy that
Professor Engler felt convinced (cf. p. <a href="#Page_171">171</a>) that the
occurrence of many of the Arctic plants in North
Scandinavia and Siberia could be best explained by
the assumption of such a migration from Asia <i>viâ</i>
North America to Europe rather than by the shorter
route.</p>

<p>There are far more Alpine beetles than butterflies,
but their geographical distribution is less well known,
and it is therefore not at all safe to base important
conclusions as to the origin of a fauna on that group
alone; however, as far as my limited knowledge of
the <i>Coleoptera</i> of the Alps goes, their general range
seems to agree perfectly with other orders of insects.
Many can also be traced to an Asiatic home, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
the route they came by is the Oriental and not what
I have called the Siberian.</p>

<p>Take, for instance, the genus <i>Nebria</i>, of which we
have one species in England&mdash;a black insect with a
bright reddish-yellow border and long light legs&mdash;known
as <i>N. livida</i>. There are about eighty European
species, most of which are confined to the Alps,
the Caucasus, the Pyrenees, Spain, and Greece. The
genus, however, ranges all over the Holarctic Region,
that is to say roughly, over Europe, Central and
Northern Asia, and North America. The centre of
distribution lies in Central Asia. If the genus had
poured into Europe by the northern or Siberian
route, we should probably now find many species in
Northern Russia, Germany, and France; but this is
not the case, and we may therefore assume with some
justification that the Southern or Oriental route was
the only one available at the time when the bulk of
the species of <i>Nebria</i> wandered to Europe. Many
of the <i>Nebrias</i> occur in Switzerland and in the Alps,
generally on the margins of the snow-fields and
glaciers, like <i>N. Germari</i> and <i>Brunii</i>. Others, for
example, <i>N. atrata</i>, ascend to the highest limit of
animal life, having been observed at a height of over
10,000 feet.</p>

<p>Of the remaining orders of insects we know as yet
very little. Central Asia and even Siberia are only
beginning to be explored, and their invertebrate
fauna&mdash;except <i>Lepidoptera</i> and <i>Coleoptera</i>&mdash;is practically
unknown. However, I cannot conclude this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
short summary of some of the more characteristic
Alpine animals without referring to the Grasshoppers
which are so conspicuous in the mountains. The
mountain air simply rings during a bright summer's
day with the loud and cheerful song of millions
of these insects. It is one of the most vivid impressions
a tourist brings back from Switzerland&mdash;this
constant shrill sound issuing from an apparently
invisible source.</p>

<p>Among these Grasshoppers there are some highly
characteristic Alpine genera. <i>Pezotettix</i>&mdash;formerly
known as <i>Podisma</i>&mdash;is one of these. <i>P. alpinus</i> is
almost confined to the high Alps; with <i>P. mendax</i>
it occurs in lower levels chiefly towards the south-east,
that is to say, in the direction of Hungary,
Servia, and Dalmatia. <i>P. frigidus</i> occurs not only
in the high Alps, but also in Lapland. <i>P. Schmidti</i>
and <i>P. salamandra</i> are found in Carinthia, Servia,
and Transylvania; and one species also inhabits
the Pyrenees and another the Italian Mountains.
Finally, the only English species of <i>Pezotettix</i>,
viz. <i>P. pedestris</i>, has been taken in Sweden, Denmark,
and then again in Austria, Hungary, Servia,
etc., as far east as the Volga, and also on the high
Alps, in Sardinia and the Abruzzi Mountains in
Italy.</p>

<p>Very little, as I remarked, is known of the Asiatic
range of this genus, but either the same or a closely
allied one has many representatives in North and
South America. Whether <i>Pezotettix</i> is therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
of Asiatic origin we cannot positively affirm, but
whatever view we take, the general range of the
European species indicates that the migration took
place from the Alps in a south-easterly direction, or
to them in a north-westerly one. That is to say the
Oriental route, and not the Siberian, was utilised by
the migrants.</p>

<p>Fortunately, we know a little more about another
Grasshopper genus, called <i>Chrysochraon</i>. There are
only two species, one of which, <i>Chr. dispar</i>, has been
found from Northern France to the mountains of
Servia, but not in the Alps. The other, <i>Chr.
brachypterus</i>, has a somewhat similar range in the
plain; but, moreover, it inhabits the Alps up to a
considerable height. It is interesting to note that
both these Grasshoppers again turn up on the Amur
in Eastern Siberia.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I might mention one more Grasshopper,
viz. <i>Tettix</i>, because it includes a species&mdash;<i>T.
bipunctatus</i>&mdash;which, though well known in the plain of
Middle and North Europe, ascends the Alps to a
height of nearly 10,000 feet. It is one of the few
instances I know of an animal occurring in the
same form in such an enormous range of altitude&mdash;from
sea-level to the highest regions where animal
life is known to exist. It is also known from Asia
Minor and Siberia. <i>T. subulatus</i> has a similar distribution,
but is more common in Southern Europe
than the other. <i>T. fuliginosus</i> occurs in Lapland
and Siberia, <i>T. meridionalis</i> and <i>T. depressus</i> all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
along the shores of the Mediterranean. There can be
no doubt that here also we can trace migration to or
from Siberia, and again, as on previous occasions, by
the Oriental route.</p>

<p>We now possess a fair general idea of the fauna of
the Alps. We have learned that a good many of
the animals are indigenous, and that others have
migrated to the Alps by various routes. The majority
of these have come from Central and Southern Asia
with what has been described as the Oriental migration.
A much smaller number have reached the
Alps from the north and the west, but none of the
latter are among the high Alpine forms. What will
be the most surprising revelation is that the eastern
species, which arrived in Europe with the Siberian
migration, are practically absent from the Alps
proper. No doubt some of them still survive in the
lowlands of Switzerland and the Tyrol, but none of
the true Alpine fauna owes its origin to the Siberian
migration. If we compare the Alpine mammals with
the Siberian forms which reached England (<i>vide</i>
p. <a href="#Page_202">202</a>), we at once perceive the difference. We
should expect to find in the Alps&mdash;if not the Reindeer
and the Glutton&mdash;the Arctic Fox, the little
Pica, the Lemmings, and the pouched Marmots. It
might be urged that some of the smaller Siberian
carnivores and rodents do inhabit the Alps. So they
do. The Stoat and Weasel have found such a congenial
home in Europe, both in the plain and
mountains, that they have spread rapidly to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
latter, and no doubt reached within a comparatively
short time the great heights at which they now
occur in the Alps. But the Voles (<i>Arvicola</i>) have
scarcely spread beyond the region of fields and
cultivated ground. A height of 5000 feet at the
most marks their maximum altitude in the Alps.</p>

<p>The fauna which reached the Alps in miocene and
pliocene times, as well as the indigenous element,
must have survived the Glacial period in their
mountain home. Though I think that the conditions
of the climate at that time and the size of
the Scandinavian glaciers have been greatly exaggerated,
there can be no doubt at all about the
enormous size of many of the Alpine glaciers at this
period. The climate was probably much moister but
not colder than what it is now, possibly warmer.
The snowfall was therefore greater, so that glaciers
filled many of the lower valleys of Switzerland which
are now quite free from ice, and even invaded the
plain. But there is no reason whatsoever why the
Alps should not even then have supported a luxuriant
fauna and flora as they do now. Possibly many of
the miocene plants and animals became extinct then,
but extinction of species occurs at the present day.
We hear complaints that the Chamois and the
Steinbock have nearly vanished; we know that the
Marmot is now much scarcer than it used to be,
and that the Edelweiss and many other plants are
more and more difficult to find, and seem rapidly to
disappear. No doubt all this is in a great measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
due to the influence of man, but not altogether.
There is a constant struggle for existence going
on among the animals and plants themselves&mdash;the
stronger and fitter species driving the less fit and
weaker into a corner, where they finally succumb.
This happens now just as it did in pliocene and
pleistocene times, and need not imply change of
climate.</p>

<p>As soon as the Miocene sea to the north of the
mountains had retreated, a portion of the Alpine
fauna poured into the plain, and many species
have found their way to the British Islands, a few
to Scandinavia and Russia. Westward too, the sea
soon after retired and opened a way for those
Alpine species which were vigorous enough to extend
their range in that direction. South-eastward, of
course, a highway had long ago been open, and
Alpine forms which were able to migrate towards
the incoming Oriental stream, had no difficulty in
doing so. When they arrived in Greece, some turned
westward again and populated Sicily, Southern Italy,
Sardinia, Corsica, and Northern Africa, while others
crossed over to Asia Minor, which was then connected
with Greece, and wandered towards the
Central Asiatic or the Himalayan Mountains.</p>

<p>But, as I remarked, few of the typical Alpine
species reached Scandinavia and Lapland. I have
already referred to the similarity between the Northern
Scandinavian and the Alpine faunas in a previous
chapter, and I have shown that this resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
cannot altogether be explained by the supposition of
an interchange in the faunas of the two regions. That
this has taken place to some extent is probable, but
the resemblance appears more especially due to the
fact that the Alps and Scandinavia have been peopled
from the same centres of distribution.</p>

<p>In order to make this matter quite clear, I will give
a familiar example as an instance of the manner in
which the present distribution can be explained without
taking recourse to direct migration from the Alps
to Scandinavia or <i>vice versâ</i>. The example I will
take is that of a family of birds, not only of extreme
interest from the fact of its northern range, but also
from the pleasure it gives to those addicted to sport.
This is the grouse family, the <i>Tetraonidæ</i>.</p>

<p>Let us commence with our British Grouse (<i>Lagopus
scoticus</i>), which is peculiar to the British Islands.
In Norway we find a Grouse (<i>L. albus</i>) which differs
in habit, and in the fact of its turning white in
winter; otherwise it is so closely allied to our
Grouse that many ornithologists do not separate
them specifically. No doubt the British Grouse is a
descendant of this Scandinavian Willow-grouse. The
latter is known also to inhabit Greenland and Arctic
North America, and it is even found beyond Behring
Straits in Northern Siberia. <i>En route</i> between
Scandinavia and Asia, travelling in a westward
direction, we meet with two other very local species
of Grouse, which may be looked upon as offshoots
of <i>L. rupestris</i>&mdash;viz., <i>L. hyperboreus</i> of Spitsbergen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
and <i>leucurus</i> of Western North America. In Asia we
then again find two kinds of Grouse, very closely
related, and by some indeed regarded as belonging
to the same species. These are <i>L. rupestris</i> and
<i>L. mutus</i>. Mr. Ogilvie-Grant tells us of the former
(p. 49), that it is merely a more northern rufous form
of <i>L. mutus</i>, and that it goes through similar changes
of plumage. In summer the males are readily distinguishable,
but in winter it is impossible to tell
one from the other. "<i>L. rupestris</i> taken as a whole,"
says Mr. Ogilvie-Grant, "appears to us barely specifically
distinct from <i>L. mutus</i>." <i>L. rupestris</i> occurs
not only in Northern Asia, but crosses the Behring
Straits to Arctic America, being still found on the
Aleutian Islands, which represent the last remains
of the former land-bridge between Asia and North
America, then eastward to Greenland and Iceland.
However, while this form does not cross the confines
of Asia in a westerly direction, its near relative
<i>L. mutus</i>&mdash;better known as the Ptarmigan&mdash;does;
and may perhaps have entered Europe as a Siberian
and also as an Arctic migrant. It is still found in
the Ural Mountains, in Finland, and the highlands
of Scandinavia. It is gradually being driven out of
the Alpine lowlands, while it has long ago disappeared
from Germany, France, and Austria&mdash;in
fact, from all the lowlands of Europe. It has also
been met with in the Pyrenees and in some of the
Spanish mountains. Similarly, the bird has become
extinct in England and Ireland, while it is becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
more and more scarce in Scotland. The centre of
distribution of the genus lies in Arctic America, and
from there the genus has spread to Europe and
Asia. <i>L. albus</i> and <i>L. mutus</i> appear in our continent
chiefly as Arctic migrants.</p>

<p>The Black Grouse (<i>Lyrurus tetrix</i>) belongs to a
closely allied genus, which has only two species.
One of these is very local in distribution, being confined
to the Caucasus, but the smallness of range is
to some extent compensated for by the peculiarity
of its name, which is <i>L. mlokosiewiczi</i>. The Black
Grouse, on the contrary, is widely distributed. It
inhabits Northern Asia from the Pacific to the Ural
Mountains, and extends as far south as Pekin and
the Tian Shan range. In Europe it is found from
the extreme east to the Pyrenees, the Apennines on
the south, and to Great Britain and Scandinavia
in the north. It is important to note its absence
from Spain, the Mediterranean islands, and Ireland;
and we have learned that it is one of those Siberian
migrants which have succeeded in establishing themselves
in the Alps.</p>

<p>The Capercaillie (<i>Tetrao urogallus</i>)&mdash;another great
favourite with sportsmen&mdash;is now generally separated
generically from the Black Grouse, though they are
of course near relations. Its range greatly resembles
that of the Black Grouse, except that it does not go
quite as far east in Siberia, not having been met
with beyond Lake Baikal. From there it is found
westward as far as the Pyrenees. It occurs also in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the Carpathians and the Alps. In England, where it
used to be known by the name Cock of the Wood, it
became extinct at some remote period in history,
while it lingered on in Scotland and Ireland until
the end of the last century. In Scotland it has been
reintroduced into several counties, and being protected,
it appears to spread from these artificial
centres of distribution.</p>

<p>Like the Black Cock, the Capercaillie is a Siberian
migrant, and it is one of the few Siberian species
which have reached Ireland, as I have had occasion
to mention in dealing with the origin of the British
fauna. Two other species of Capercaillie and an
allied genus (<i>Falcipennis</i>) are met with in the extreme
north-east of Siberia, and six other genera, all belonging
to the grouse family, are confined to
North America. We have therefore a very intimate
relationship between the grouse of Asia and those of
North America, some species even ranging right
across the two continents.</p>

<p>The last genus of this very interesting family is
<i>Tetrastes</i>. This grouse is not familiar to British
ornithologists, since it is entirely absent from the
British Islands. But sportsmen who have tramped
over Scandinavia know it well by the name of
Hazel Grouse. It is ashy grey in colour, barred and
vermiculated with black. The Common Hazel
Grouse (<i>Tetrastes bonasia</i>) is found from Northern
Spain in the west right through the mountainous
parts of Central and Northern Europe and Northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
Asia to Kamtchatka and the Russian convict island
of Saghalien in the Pacific. Besides the Common
Hazel Grouse, two other species are known, one from
Eastern Russia and the other from China.</p>

<p>Having now shortly reviewed the whole grouse
family, we have seen that, although some species
live within the Polar Circle, the majority are
more or less confined to the more temperate
or rather the less arctic parts of the Northern
Hemisphere. They are quite absent from Southern
Asia and even the southern parts of North America,
and almost so from the Mediterranean basin. The
whole range of the family is therefore suggestive of
a northern origin, and this view agrees perfectly with
all the details of distribution. The centre of distribution
lies in Northern Asia, or in Arctic North
America. From there the great genus <i>Lagopus</i>
spread east and west, reaching Europe by these
vastly divergent routes at a time when the physical
geography was very different from what it is to-day.
Several of the species common to the Alps
and Scandinavia have migrated from Siberia direct
to Eastern Europe. But we can now imagine how
from a similar centre in Asia&mdash;perhaps at a rather
more remote time&mdash;a species spread eastward across
North America and Greenland to Scandinavia, and
westward along the mountain ranges of the Tian
Shan and the mountains of Asia Minor to Greece,
and finally to the Alps. We should then have the
same species in the Alps and in Scandinavia, not far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
removed from one another; but how different were
their paths of migration! This, however, is not an
imaginary instance. Such a migration must have
actually taken place in a good number of instances
among the terrestrial invertebrates and also among
plants.</p>

<p>The view still current among many zoologists and
botanists, that animals and plants were driven down
into the plain from the mountains of Europe during
the height of the Glacial period and there lived
together till the return of a more genial temperature,
when they retreated to their mountain homes, is a
very plausible one. During their sojourn in the
plain, the plants and animals&mdash;say from Scandinavia&mdash;intermingled
with those from the Alps; and
when the time of separation came, many Alpine
forms retired northward with the Scandinavians,
while many Scandinavians would go with the
Alpines to their home. In this way the similarity
between the Alpine and Scandinavian faunas and
floras is assumed to have been brought about.
These theories, first promulgated by Edward Forbes,
were hailed with general satisfaction by the scientific
world. Even Darwin says of them (p. 331), that
grounded as they are on the perfectly well-ascertained
occurrence of a former Glacial period,
they seemed to him to explain in a satisfactory
manner the present distribution of the Alpine and
Arctic productions of Europe. To the present day
this view meets with much favour among naturalists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
It is somewhat similar to one which has recently
been strongly supported by Professor Nehring and
accepted by Professor Th. Studer and many others.
They have never made it quite clear whether the
pre-glacial fauna and flora are supposed to have
been absolutely destroyed by the glacial climate,
or whether part of them have been able to take
refuge somewhere in the south; but the great mass
of our Alpine plants and animals are believed to
have been derived from the Siberian invasion, which
I have fully described in the fifth chapter. This
invasion spread over the European plain, and when
the climate ameliorated, both animals and plants
migrated north and south to the mountains. This
view agrees with the earlier theory, except that the
adaptation to Alpine conditions would, according to
the former, have taken place since the close of the
Glacial period, during which time no such modification
or change of species seems to have been produced
in other parts of the world. The characteristic
fauna of the Alps, as has been gathered from
the preceding pages, is mainly of Central Asiatic
rather than of Siberian origin. Migration to the
Alps took place by the Oriental route long before
the Siberian invasion. Some of the species of the
latter have penetrated to the Alps, but these Siberian
species have not given to the fauna of the highest
European mountain range the striking character with
which we all associate it.</p>

<p>Before concluding this chapter, a few remarks on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
the botanical aspect of the Alpine problem might not
be out of place. It will enable us to judge which of
the views indicated is the more probable, and will
add to the interest which may have been aroused by
the perusal of this sketch of the fauna of the Alps.
Very much the same train of argument was applied
as to the course of events in the formation of the
Alpine flora as in the case of the fauna. The plants
were all supposed to have been killed or driven away
by the arctic temperature of the Glacial period, and
their place taken by new migrants from the north or
east when the climate ameliorated.</p>

<p>Professor Engler, one of the highest living
authorities on the geographical distribution of plants,
is of opinion (p. 102) that a large number of the
indigenous Alpine species did not originate till after
the close of the Glacial period, because so many of
them are absent from the Sierra Nevada in Spain,
where the condition for their well-being exists,
while many have evidently spread from the
Alps to the Carpathian Mountains and to the
Pyrenees. He does not believe that a glacial flora
could have existed in the plain between the Sierra
Nevada and the Pyrenees during the Glacial period
(p. 109). In speaking of the Caucasus, Professor
Engler informs us (p. 117) that a good many species
which do not occur in the Alps reached these
mountains from Siberia. Apart from the northern
glacial plants, the Caucasus has only few species in
common with the Alps, more with the Balkan mountains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>and Northern Persia. Turning to Afghanistan,
our author mentions (p. 121) a few Alpine plants as
occurring in that country, and likewise in the
Caucasus and the Himalayas. He considers it
probable that the route of migration of some glacial
plants from the east to the west, and <i>vice versâ</i>, lay
across the Afghan mountains. Many of our Alpine
plants occur in the Siberian mountains, but in the Altaï
and Eastern Siberia generally a considerable number
of these are by no means confined to the mountains
(p. 125). They are also met with in the lower regions,
and the rare Alpine Edelweiss (<i>Leontopodium alpinum</i>)
frequently covers wide tracts in the plain, and is
passed by almost unnoticed by the Siberian botanist.</p>

<p>Special attention is drawn by Professor Engler to
the fact (p. 130) that several of the Siberian plants
inhabit the Alps and the Caucasus, but are not
found in Scandinavia. And from this he deduces the
conclusion that part of the Siberian flora migrated
in a south-westerly direction towards the Caucasus
and the mountains of the Mediterranean area, exactly
in the manner indicated in respect to the fauna of the
Alps. We learned that the migration to the Alps
from Central and perhaps also parts of Northern
Asia took a south-westerly course first, and was
then followed by one in an easterly direction. I
called the former the Oriental migration and the
latter the Siberian. Later on Professor Engler
states (p. 142) that the main mass of the Siberian
forms of plants certainly wandered westward to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
the south of the Ural. This is proved by the
numerous glacial plants found in the Caucasus, while
the glacial flora of the Ural Mountains is poor.
Finally, he expresses the opinion that the probability
of most of the Alpine plants occurring in Arctic
Siberia, having wandered from the Alps, by way
of Scandinavia, Greenland, and North America, to
North-eastern Siberia, is greater than the direct
migration from Europe to Siberia (p. 143).</p>

<p>Another continental writer on the Alpine flora who
deserves special mention is Dr. Christ. His observation
that Alpine plants by no means suffer from a
high temperature (p. 309), but solely from a drying
up of the soil, seems to me to point to the correctness
of the view I have expressed on several occasions,
that these plants have originated long before the
Glacial period at a time when the climate was
warmer and moister than it is now. It seems quite
natural to Dr. Christ that the Arcto-Alpine flora
should have originated in Asia, but he excepts thirty
species which are absent from Northern Asia, though
occurring in America (p. 327). These he thinks have
penetrated direct from America to the Alps by way
of Scandinavia, since no less than twenty-three still
occur in the latter country. In the human population
of the Alps, he continues (p. 336), one can distinguish
an indigenous Celtic race, a Germanic colder and
more apathetic race, and a more lively Roman one.
The flora is composed of quite a similar mixture.
We find also an indigenous element&mdash;an Arctic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
a Mediterranean one. The last element is a survival
of the Tertiary flora of the Central European plateau
(p. 532). The plants were driven down to the shores
of the Mediterranean, and it is only after the retreat
of the glaciers that a few of them have been able to
regain their ancient territory. The incoming Asiatic
and North American flora likewise retired at the end
of the Glacial period to the Alps and the Arctic
countries, and left isolated traces of its former
abundance on the North European plain. The
bulk of the Arctic or Alpine flora is held to be
of Asiatic origin. Since Siberia shows little trace
of having been glaciated, owing to the dryness of the
climate, a rich flora was able to develop there, which
spread into Europe as soon as the vanishing glaciers
made room for it.</p>

<p>These are the views of Professor Engler and Dr.
Christ. They agree in so far as both of them maintain
that the bulk of the Alpine flora is post-glacial&mdash;that
is to say, that it has developed quite
recently, or migrated to the Alps after the glaciers
had retreated from the plain to the mountain
recesses. It is assumed by Dr. Christ that while
Europe was practically uninhabitable, a rich flora
survived in Northern Asia, because the climate there
was too dry for the development of glaciers. Due
consideration in this interesting speculation, however,
is not given to the fact which he himself emphasised,
that Alpine plants are particularly prone to suffer
from a dry climate. Even a moderately dry cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
kills most of them. How can we then reconcile this
fact with the theory of their origin in a dry and
intensely cold climate? I quite agree with the views
as to the Asiatic origin of the bulk of the Alpine flora,
while the dry state of the Siberian climate is certainly
indicated by the extremely feeble development of the
glaciers during a large part of the Glacial period.
We know, however, that in Pliocene and even in
early Glacial times the atmospheric conditions must
have been very different in Siberia. A great slice of
Central Asia was under water, and numerous freshwater
lakes covered the lowlands in the north, so
that the climate must have been damp though not
cold enough for the formation of extensive glaciers.
Everything, in fact, seems to indicate that the migration
of the Asiatic Alpine flora took place at a very
early date&mdash;probably long before the Glacial period&mdash;either
by the Oriental or by the Arctic route <i>viâ</i>
North America, Greenland, and Scandinavia. But
would this not necessitate a survival of the Alpine
plants in the Alps themselves? That is the view which
has already been expressed with regard to the fauna,
and the flora probably followed a very similar course.
This is by no means a novel theory, however, and
though unfortunately an untimely death has removed
one of our very best authorities on the Alpine flora
before he had completed his life's work, we have
some indications in the earlier writings of John Ball
that his opinions on the origin of that flora did not
coincide with those held by the leading continental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
authors. To quote the words of this distinguished
botanist (p. 576): "Is it credible that in the short
interval since the close of the Glacial period hundreds
of very distinct species and several genera have been
developed in the Alps, and&mdash;what is no less hard to
conceive&mdash;that several of these non-Arctic species
and genera should still more recently have been
distributed at wide intervals throughout a discontinuous
chain some 1500 miles in length, from the
Pyrenees to the Eastern Carpathians? Nor would
the difficulties cease there. You would have left unexplained
the fact that many of the non-Arctic types
which are present in the Alps are represented in the
mountains of distant regions, not by the same,
but by allied species, which must have descended
from a common ancestor; that one species of
<i>Wulfenia</i>, for example, inhabits one small corner of
the Alps, that another is found in Northern Syria,
while a third allied species has its home in the
Himalaya." Mr. Ball is of opinion (p. 584) that
the effects of the Glacial period have been greatly
overrated. "Even during the period of maximum
cold the highest ridges of the Alps were not completely
covered with snow and ice; for we still see
by the appearance of the surface, the limit above
which the ancient ice did not reach, and in the middle
zone the slopes that rose above the ancient glaciers
had a summer climate not very different from that
which now prevails. In my opinion the effect of the
Glacial period on the growth of plants in the Alps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
was to lower the vertical height of the zones of
vegetation by from one to two thousand feet." He
acknowledges that there was probably a moderate
diminution of the mean temperature of Europe with
an increased snowfall, so as to cause a great extension
of glaciers on all the mountains of Northern Europe.
"But that the climate of Middle Europe was such that
the plants of the high Alps could spread across the
plains seems to me an improbable supposition"
(p. 584).</p>

<p>On the Continent, also, some botanists seem to
feel that Forbes's theories of the origin of the
Alpine flora, which were at first hailed with such
delight, and accepted by almost every naturalist as
the final verdict, must be modified in the light
of recent researches. Professor Krasan believes that
many plants which now live in the high Alps
flourished in pliocene times at sea-level (p. 37).
"Especially the evergreen species exhibit the impression
of an originally mild climate&mdash;of a climate
without winter frosts&mdash;for otherwise the plants
would have developed into species with deciduous
leaves." To the favourable conditions, consisting in
periodic snowfalls and high summer temperature,
must be attributed the fact that in the highlands so
many more species from Tertiary times have survived
than in the plains. The temperature was probably
much higher during the Glacial period than is
generally believed. The climate was more moist,
thus contributing to an abundant snowfall, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
survivors of ancient Tertiary times were able to
repeople the parts which were temporarily devastated
by the advancing glaciers.</p>

<p>In so short a chapter it is impossible to deal with
the Alpine fauna in a manner more deserving of this
theme. I have merely sought to give a sketch of
the general outlines of the subject and to suggest
another possible mode of origin of Alpine animals
than that currently believed in by naturalists. It is
to be hoped these suggestions will be useful to those
intending to reinvestigate the problems raised in this
chapter. When our knowledge of the fauna of Asia
is more complete, it will be possible to give a more
thorough and in many respects a more satisfactory
history of the European fauna than at present.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY OF CHAPTER VIII.</h3>


<p>In early Tertiary times the area now covered by the European
Alps was covered by the sea. Islands slowly rose above the
surface of the waters, which finally coalesced to form a peninsula
connected with the mainland in the east. Animals now began
to invade the new territory which continued to rise, while the
sea retired farther and farther to the north and south. During
the Pliocene Epoch the sea ceased to wash the northern shores
of the Alps, and both emigration and immigration became
possible in that direction, and also from and to the west.</p>

<p>The Alpine fauna and also the flora are made up of a number
of elements, the eastern one being the oldest. The latter is
represented in the Alps by the older and newer Oriental migration.
The general range of the Alpine Steinbock, Chamois,
Marmot, Vole, Shrew, and Hare are specially referred to. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
Alpine birds are few in number, and all of them are readily
traceable to an Asiatic ancestry. Among the Amphibia, the
Salamanders are considered of Alpine origin.</p>

<p>Dr. Kobelt tells us that a uniformity of character marks the
Alpine molluscan fauna. <i>Campylaea</i>,&mdash;often considered a sub-genus
of <i>Helix</i>,&mdash;<i>Pomatias</i>, <i>Zonites</i>, are looked upon as truly
Alpine genera. For very long periods the Alps seem to have
received no addition to their molluscan fauna from other areas.
The case is very different with the <i>Lepidoptera</i>, some of the
most striking species being evidently Asiatic immigrants.
Some examples of <i>Coleoptera</i> and <i>Orthoptera</i> are mentioned,
and their origin discussed.</p>

<p>We find as the result of these considerations that the
majority of the Alpine species are either indigenous or have
come from Asia with the Oriental migration. None of the
northern or western immigrants appear to be among the
characteristic Alpine species, and it seems that the Siberian
migrants have not retired to the Alps, as some naturalists have
been led to suppose. It is evident that the fauna must have
survived the Glacial period on the Alps, though according
to geological evidence glaciers of enormous size originated
on these mountains.</p>

<p>The identity of many Alpine species with Scandinavian ones
appears at first sight due to a direct migration from the Alps
to Scandinavia or <i>vice versâ</i>. Perhaps such a migration has
taken place to some extent, but it is probable that from a Central
Asiatic centre some species spread across Arctic America into
Northern Europe, and also westward to the Alps. The Grouse
family forms an interesting example.</p>

<p>There are two older theories which explain the similarity
between the Scandinavian and Alpine faunas. Forbes's view,
which gained most adherents among naturalists, was that the
Scandinavian and Alpine animals were driven into the plain by
the cold during the Glacial period, and when they ultimately
regained their homes, some individuals of the northern species<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
moved southward, and a few of the southern ones northward.
By the more recent theory of Nehring, the Siberian animals
which invaded our continent from the east, and then spread
northward to Scandinavia and southward to the Alps, formed
the nucleus of the faunas of these two areas. The objections
to both of these views are fully set forth in this chapter.</p>

<p>A few remarks on the botanical aspect of the Alpine problem
conclude the chapter. The origin of the flora has been explained
in a very similar manner to that of the fauna. But
already Ball and Krasan have raised their voices against the
current theories, as the facts of distribution appear to them
more satisfactorily explained on lines more consonant with
those which I have used in discussing the origin of the Alpine
fauna. One of the most important conclusions obtained by this
study of the flora in conjunction with the fauna, is that I have
emphasised in most of the preceding chapters&mdash;viz., that the
Glacial period in Europe was not a time of extreme cold,
and that its destructive effect on the animals and plants was by
no means such as is currently believed.</p>

Taylor</span>. Illustrated. Second Edition. 3s. 6d.</p>

Masterly and exhaustive."&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.</p></blockquote>

Illustrated. Second Edition. 3s. 6d.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Brings this highly interesting subject even with the latest researches....
Professor Mantegazza is a writer full of life and spirit, and the natural attractiveness
of his subject is not destroyed by his scientific handling of it."&mdash;<i>Literary World</i> (Boston).</p></blockquote>

<p>V. EVOLUTION AND DISEASE. By <span class="smcap">J. B. Sutton</span>, F.R.C.S.
With 135 Illustrations. 3s. 6d.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The book is as interesting as a novel, without sacrifice of accuracy or system, and
is calculated to give an appreciation of the fundamentals of pathology to the lay
reader, while forming a useful collection of illustrations of disease for medical
reference."&mdash;<i>Journal of Mental Science</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>VI. THE VILLAGE COMMUNITY. By <span class="smcap">G. L. Gomme</span>.
Illustrated. 3s. 6d.</p>

bearing on those traces of the village community which have not been effaced by

<span class="smcap">Letourneau</span>. Second Edition. 3s. 6d.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Among the distinguished French students of sociology, Professor Letourneau has
long stood in the first rank. He approaches the great study of man free from bias
and shy of generalisations. To collect, scrutinise, and appraise facts is his chief
business. In the volume before us he shows these qualities in an admirable degree."&mdash;<i>Science</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>XV. EDUCATION AND HEREDITY. By <span class="smcap">J. M. Guyau</span>.
3s. 6d.</p>

<blockquote><p>"It is at once a treatise on sociology, ethics, and pedagogics. It is doubtful
whether among all the ardent evolutionists who have had their say on the moral
and the educational question any one has carried forward the new doctrine so boldly
to its extreme logical consequence."&mdash;Professor <span class="smcap">Sully</span> in <i>Mind</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>XX. PUBLIC HEALTH. By Dr. <span class="smcap">J. F. J. Sykes</span>. With
numerous Illustrations. 3s. 6d.</p>

<p>XXI. MODERN METEOROLOGY. <span class="smcap">An Account of the
Growth and Present Condition of some Branches of

By <span class="smcap">August Weismann</span>, Professor in the University of Freiburg-in-Breisgau.
With 24 Illustrations. 6s.</p>

<blockquote><p>"There has been no work published since Darwin's own books which has so
thoroughly handled the matter treated by him, or has done so much to place in order
and clearness the immense complexity of the factors of heredity, or, lastly, has
brought to light so many new facts and considerations bearing on the subject."&mdash;<i>British
Medical Journal</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>XXIII. INDUSTRIES OF ANIMALS. By <span class="smcap">F. Houssay</span>.
With numerous Illustrations. 3s. 6d.</p>

here made use of as materials wherewith to form the mighty fabric of evolution."&mdash;<i>Manchester
Guardian</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>XXIV. MAN AND WOMAN. By <span class="smcap">Havelock Ellis</span>. Illustrated.
Second Edition. 6s.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Mr. Havelock Ellis belongs, in some measure, to the continental school of anthropologists;
but while equally methodical in the collection of facts, he is far more
cautious in the invention of theories, and he has the further distinction of being not
only able to think, but able to write. His book is a sane and impartial consideration,
from a psychological and anthropological point of view, of a subject which is
certainly of primary interest."&mdash;<i>Athenæum</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>XXV. THE EVOLUTION OF MODERN CAPITALISM.
By <span class="smcap">John A. Hobson</span>, M.A. 3s. 6d.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Every page affords evidence of wide and minute study, a weighing of facts as
conscientious as it is acute, a keen sense of the importance of certain points as to
which economists of all schools have hitherto been confused and careless, and an
impartiality generally so great as to give no indication of his [Mr. Hobson's] personal
sympathies."&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>XXVI. APPARITIONS AND THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE.
By <span class="smcap">Frank Podmore</span>, M.A. 3s. 6d.</p>

<blockquote><p>"A very sober and interesting little book.... That thought-transference is a
real thing, though not perhaps a very common thing, he certainly shows."&mdash;<i>Spectator</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>XXVII. AN INTRODUCTION TO COMPARATIVE
PSYCHOLOGY. By Professor <span class="smcap">C. Lloyd Morgan</span>, F.R.S. With
Diagrams. 6s.</p>

<blockquote><p>"A strong and complete exposition of Psychology, as it takes shape in a mind
previously informed with biological science.... Well written, extremely entertaining,
and intrinsically valuable."&mdash;<i>Saturday Review</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>XXVIII. THE ORIGINS OF INVENTION: <span class="smcap">A Study of
Industry among Primitive Peoples.</span> By <span class="smcap">Otis T. Mason</span>,
Curator of the Department of Ethnology in the United States National
Museum. 3s. 6d.</p>

much care, judgment, and discrimination."&mdash;<i>The Lancet</i>.</p></blockquote>

Life-Histories of Designs.</span> By Professor <span class="smcap">Alfred C. Haddon</span>,

<blockquote><p>"It is impossible to speak too highly of this most unassuming and invaluable
book."&mdash;<i>Journal Anthropological Institute</i>.</p></blockquote>

<span class="smcap">Th. Ribot</span>, Professor at the College of France, Editor of the <i>Revue
Philosophique</i>. 6s.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Charmingly written, and full of lucid explanation and brilliant comparison. A
masterly exposition."&mdash;<i>British Medical Journal</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>XXXII. HALLUCINATIONS AND ILLUSIONS: <span class="smcap">A Study
of the Fallacies of Perception.</span> By <span class="smcap">Edmund Parish</span>. 6s.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The most comprehensive and most scientific work on false perception that has up
till now been written in any language."&mdash;<i>Journal of Mental Science</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>XXXIII. THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY. By <span class="smcap">E. W. Scripture</span>,
<span class="smcap">Ph.D.</span> (Leipzig). With 124 Illustrations. 6s.</p>

With a large number of Illustrations and Diagrams. 6s.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Dr. Gillespie's work is one that has been greatly needed. No comprehensive
collation of this kind exists in recent English literature. All the important work
that has appeared within the past few years is discussed so far as the limits of the
book allow of discussion, and extremely little of value has been omitted. Not least
interesting are the accounts of the author's own original work."&mdash;<i>American Journal
of the Medical Sciences</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p class="center"><b><span style="font-size:150%;">The Music of the Poets:</span></b></p>

<p class="center">A MUSICIANS' BIRTHDAY BOOK</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Compiled by</span> ELEONORE D'ESTERRE-KEELING.</p>

<p>This is an entirely new edition of this popular work. The size has been
altered, the page having been made a little longer and narrower (9 × 6<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>
inches), thus allowing space for a larger number of autographs. The
setting-up of the pages has also been improved, and a large number of
names of composers, instrumentalists and singers, has been added to those
which appeared in the previous edition. A special feature of the book
consists in the reproduction in fac-simile of autographs, and autographic
music, of living composers; among the many new autographs which have
been added to the present edition being those of MM. Paderewski (to whom
the book is dedicated), Mascagni, Eugen d'Albert, Sarasate, Hamish
McCunn, and C. Hubert Parry. Merely as a volume of poetry about music,
this book makes a charming anthology, the selections of verse extending
from a period anterior to Chaucer to the present day.</p>

<p><i>Among the additional writers represented in the new edition are Alfred
Austin, Arthur Christopher Benson, John Davidson, Norman Gale,
Richard Le Gallienne, Nora Hopper, Jean Ingelow, George Meredith,
Alice Meynell, Coventry Patmore, Mary Robinson, Francis Thompson,
Dr. Todhunter, Katharine Tynan, William Watson, and W. B. Yeats.
The new edition is illustrated with portraits of Handel, Beethoven, Bach,
Gluck, Chopin, Wagner, Liszt, Rubinstein, and others. The compiler has
taken the greatest pains to make the new edition of the work as complete
as possible; and a new binding has been specially designed by an eminent
artist.</i></p>

<div class="likeheading2"><b>BIRDS OF THE BRITISH ISLES</b></div>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Drawn and Described by</span> JOHN DUNCAN.</p>


<p>This volume contains about 400 drawings of birds
by John Duncan, naturalist and artist. The drawings
are accompanied by a concise description of each bird.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. Chas. Dixon, in the Introduction to this work,
says:&mdash;"Just a century ago, British naturalists and the
British public were captivated by the first volume of
Bewick's classic <i>History of British Birds</i>&mdash;a work, completed
by the issue of the second volume seven years later,
that gave more or less accurate pictures of all the species,
and one that has retained a high place in the affections of
ornithologists and artistic people generally down to the
present time. To a certain extent, Mr. Duncan's volume
very closely resembles the immortal engraver on wood;
and in some respects, as those who have the pleasure of
inspecting his remarkable series of drawings will find for
themselves, it is superior. The present book, so far as
British birds are concerned, is practically unique. For the
first time, an up-to-date manual, containing an accurate
and artistic picture of every species, is placed within the
reach of the multitude by reason of its very modest price."</p>

<p>The Natural History of Digestion.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">BY A. LOCKHART GILLESPIE</span>,
M.D., F.R.C.P. ED., F.R.S. ED.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dr. Gillespie, who has long been known as an original investigator in
this department of physiology, has in the present volume attempted to
bring together all the facts and recent discoveries bearing on this subject
of great scientific and practical importance. Dealing with the subject in
much detail, as well as broadly and comprehensively, the book appeals
both to medical specialist and general reader. The author shows that
digestion is a process which occurs throughout animated nature, and
beginning with digestion in plants, and describing many original and
other experiments with carnivorous plants, he passes on to digestion in
the lower animals, and then deals fully with the many complicated problems
offered by digestion in the higher animals and man. The practical
questions of diet are examined in their various aspects, and the influence
of alcohol, tea, and other stimulants discussed.</p>

<p>Degeneracy:
ITS CAUSES, SIGNS, AND RESULTS.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">By Professor EUGENE S. TALBOT</span>, M.D., Chicago.</p></blockquote>

<p>This volume presents, in a simple and comprehensive way, the basis of
fact on which the speculations of Nordau and others have been founded.
It is the first book written in English by a competent authority dealing
broadly with this subject. The author deals with more especial fulness
with the signs of degeneracy in the head and face&mdash;ears, jaws, teeth, etc.&mdash;as
those which he has chiefly studied, and which are of most general
interest; but he also discusses degeneracy in the body generally, as well
as its mental forms. The chief causes tending to produce degeneracy in
modern life are discussed&mdash;heredity, climate, foods, alcohol, education,
etc.&mdash;and the methods of combating them considered. The book is fully
illustrated, chiefly from original photographs.</p>

to reveal themselves. There never was such a mirror held up to nature
before; it is too terrible.... Yet we must return to Ibsen, with his
remorseless surgery, his remorseless electric-light, until we, too, have
grown strong and learned to face the naked&mdash;if necessary, the flayed and
bleeding&mdash;reality.</i>'&mdash;<span class="smcap">Speaker</span> (London).</p></blockquote>
